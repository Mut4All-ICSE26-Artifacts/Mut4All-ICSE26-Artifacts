Mutation Operator:

Target: Type Alias with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a type alias declared with `impl Trait`, e.g., `pub type Alias = impl Trait;`.
2. Modify the alias to include a trait bound that conflicts with its intended use or does not make sense in the given context.
3. Ensure that the semantic constraints of the program are violated to provoke erroneous type resolution.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Identify the type alias using `impl Trait`. For instance, `pub type Alias = impl Trait;`.
- Determine the existing trait bounds associated with the alias, or lack thereof.
- Introduce an incompatible or conflicting trait bound. For example, if the alias implies a sized constraint, you might introduce an unsized constraint or a trait that explicitly requires different functionality.
- Adjust the code using this alias to align with the new constraints, potentially leading to a mismatch. For example, use a function that requires a different trait or operation that conflicts with the new bound.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
pub type ExampleAlias = impl Sized;

pub fn example_function(val: ExampleAlias) {
    // Function logic
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
pub type ExampleAlias = impl AsRef<[u8]> + Unpin; // Adds conflicting bounds

pub fn example_function(val: ExampleAlias) {
    // Attempt operations that may conflict with the new bounds
    let reference: &[u8] = val.as_ref(); // This usage may not align with the new constraints
}
```

This mutation operator aims to induce inconsistencies in type resolution, potentially triggering ICEs or unexpected behaviors in the Rust compiler.
