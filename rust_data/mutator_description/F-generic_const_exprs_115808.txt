Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation

Target: Impl block for a trait on a struct (e.g., `impl Trait for Struct`)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation block `impl Trait for Struct { ... }`.
2. Within the implementation block, locate a type associated with a trait function, such as `type Output = ...`.
3. Modify the type definition or constraints in a way that changes the relationship between types or traits, but maintain syntax correctness.
4. For example, if the original code is `type Output = Tensor<T, N>;`, alter it to `type Output = Tensor<T, { N + 1 }>;` or introduce a type conflict by altering the trait constraint, such as changing a trait bound from `I: Concat<J>` to `I: Concat<K>`, where `K` is not related to `J`.

Example:
Given the original code:
```rust
impl<I, J, const N: usize> Mul<Tensor<J, N>> for Tensor<I, N>
where
    I: Concat<J>,
    <I as Concat<J>>::Output: Indices<N>,
{
    type Output = Tensor<<I as Concat<J>>::Output, N>;
}
```

Modify to:
```rust
impl<I, J, const N: usize> Mul<Tensor<J, N>> for Tensor<I, N>
where
    I: Concat<J>,
    <I as Concat<J>>::Output: Indices<N + 1>,
{
    type Output = Tensor<<I as Concat<J>>::Output, N>;
}
```

This mutation changes the expectation of the trait bound and the associated type, potentially triggering issues related to generic constant expressions during compilation.
