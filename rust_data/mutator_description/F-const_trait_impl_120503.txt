Mutation Operator: Modify Function Keywords in Trait Implementations

Target: Functions within trait implementations.

Description: This mutation operator focuses on altering the keyword order and combination in function declarations within trait implementations to explore how the compiler handles these changes.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Locate a function definition within a trait implementation.
2. Identify if the function uses any of the keywords `async`, `const`, `unsafe`, `extern`, or `fn`.
3. If the function uses `async` and `const` in combination, swap the order of these keywords.
4. If the function uses any of the other combinations (like `const` and `unsafe`), attempt to introduce conflicts by modifying their order similarly.
5. If both `async` and `const` are present, attempt to remove one of them and observe the behavior.
6. Ensure that the function is being implemented for a trait, as this often results in incompatibilities or unexpected compiler behavior.

Example: Given a function in a trait implementation like:

```
trait MyTrait {}
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async const fn example(&self) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

Apply the mutation:

- Swap `async` and `const` to `const async`:
```
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    const async fn example(&self) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

- Remove `async`:
```
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    const fn example(&self) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

- Remove `const`:
```
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async fn example(&self) {
        // some code
    }
}
```

These mutations target the keyword combinations that can lead to ICEs or other unexpected compiler errors, especially when involving trait implementations and function modifications.
