Mutation Operator

Target Construct: Trait Definition

Mutation Rule: Modify the associated type bounds within trait definitions to introduce recursive const trait bounds.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Locate a trait definition in the seed program. This trait should have one or more associated types.
2. Identify an associated type within the trait that has a trait bound.
3. Change the bound of the associated type to include itself as a bound through a const trait.
4. Ensure that the trait bound includes both the const keyword and references the trait itself.

Example Before Mutation:
```
trait MyTrait {
    type AssocType;
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```
#[const_trait]
trait MyTrait {
    type AssocType: const MyTrait;
}
```

Explanation: This mutation operator takes a trait definition and modifies its associated type to have a self-referential const trait bound. This serves to stress-test the compiler's handling of const trait bounds and can help identify issues related to recursive bounds and const trait implementation.
