Mutation Operator: Modify Return Path in Function

Target Code Construct: Function with Conditional Logic

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that utilizes conditional logic (e.g., if-else statements) to determine its return value.
2. Within the conditional block, ensure that both the if and the else branches provide a return value of the same type.
3. Introduce a divergence by modifying the return type of the else branch:
   a. If the else branch currently does not return anything or returns a value of the expected type, change it to return a boxed dynamic trait object.
   b. Change the return expression in the else branch to `Box::new(<expression>)` where `<expression>` implements the required trait, but may not match the original expected return type directly.
4. Ensure that the new return type in the else branch doesn't conflict with the type expected by the function's signature, causing potential type inconsistency.

Example:
Given the original code:
```
fn example_function(condition: bool) -> impl std::fmt::Debug {
    if condition {
        "example"
    } else {
        42
    }
}
```

Apply mutation:
```
fn example_function(condition: bool) -> impl std::fmt::Debug {
    if condition {
        "example"
    } else {
        Box::new(42)
    }
}
```

In this example, the return type in the else branch is changed to a boxed integer, which may not directly satisfy the `impl std::fmt::Debug` return type due to the way `Foo` is defined, leading to potential inconsistencies when the code is compiled. This mutation manipulates the inner workings of return type inference and can induce compiler bugs related to type resolution and trait implementation.
