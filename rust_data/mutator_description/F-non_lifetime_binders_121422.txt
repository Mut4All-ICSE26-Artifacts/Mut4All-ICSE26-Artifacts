Mutation Operator

Target: Function Return Type with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions in the seed program that utilize `impl Trait` in their return type, such as `fn example() -> impl TraitType { ... }`.
2. Modify the `impl Trait` return type to include a nested and more complex trait structure. For example, change `impl TraitType` to `impl TraitType<Assoc = impl AnotherTrait>`.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate any function in the code with a return type of `impl Trait`.
- If the function does not include associated types in the `impl Trait`, introduce one by specifying an associated type with another trait, similar to the structure: `impl Trait<Assoc = impl AnotherTrait>`.
- Ensure that `AnotherTrait` is defined in the scope, or add a simple definition for it, such as:
  ```rust
  trait AnotherTrait {}
  ```
- Make sure to modify the associated type in such a way that it attempts to resolve another trait within it.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn example() -> impl MyTrait {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
trait AnotherTrait {}

fn example() -> impl MyTrait<Assoc = impl AnotherTrait> {
    // function body
}
```

This mutation operator aims to test the compilerâ€™s handling of nested trait resolutions within `impl Trait`, which could potentially expose issues with bounds or definitions similar to the bug report.
