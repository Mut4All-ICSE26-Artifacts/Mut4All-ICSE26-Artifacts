Mutation Operator 

Target: Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule: Modify the signature of an async function within a trait implementation.

Steps:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the codebase. Ensure the trait contains an async function.
2. Within the trait implementation, locate the async function definition.
3. Change the async function signature to a non-async function.
4. Remove the `async` keyword from the function definition and alter any code inside the function that relies on async execution.

Example:
Original Code:
```
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    async fn example_function(&self);
}

impl ExampleTrait for SomeType {
    async fn example_function(&self) {
        // Some async code here
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    async fn example_function(&self);
}

impl ExampleTrait for SomeType {
    fn example_function(&self) {
        // Synchronous version of the code here
    }
}
```

This mutation operator exploits the interaction between async functions and trait implementations, which might cause the compiler to process the code differently, thus exposing potential bugs related to async function handling within traits.
