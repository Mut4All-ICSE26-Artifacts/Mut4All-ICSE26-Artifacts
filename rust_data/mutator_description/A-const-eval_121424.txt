Mutation Operator

Target: Struct Definitions

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct declaration in the Rust code. The struct should have at least one type parameter with a trait bound.
2. Change the trait bound of the type parameter to an incompatible trait that is unlikely to be satisfied by the types used in the program.
3. If the struct is used with a type that does not satisfy the new trait bound, replace it with a type that does not satisfy the modified trait bound.

Example:
- Original Code:
  ```rust
  struct MyStruct<T: Copy>(T);
  let instance: MyStruct<u32> = MyStruct(100);
  ```
  
- Mutated Code:
  ```rust
  struct MyStruct<T: Clone>(T);  // Change trait bound from Copy to Clone
  let instance: MyStruct<u32> = MyStruct(100);  // This line remains unchanged
  ```

Explanation:
This mutation exploits the common usage of trait bounds in structs and modifies them to potentially incompatible traits. This can lead to compilation errors if the types used do not satisfy the new trait bounds, thereby testing the compiler's ability to handle such mismatches.
