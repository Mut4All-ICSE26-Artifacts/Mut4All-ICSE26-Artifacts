Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics within Traits and Structs

This mutation operator targets Rust code that involves const generics within traits and structs, specifically focusing on modifying the way const generics are declared and utilized in these constructs. This is designed to explore edge cases and potential inconsistencies in the handling of const generics by the compiler.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait that involves a method using const generics:
   - Locate a method within a trait that takes a const generic parameter. For example, in the given code, `fn const_chunks_exact<const N: usize>(&self)` is the target.

2. Alter the const generic usage in the method signature:
   - Introduce a mismatch between the const parameter in the method signature and its usage. If the original signature is `fn const_chunks_exact<const N: usize>(&self)`, modify it to `fn const_chunks_exact<const M: usize>(&self)` and make sure the method implementation or return type still uses `N`.

3. Identify a struct that utilizes const generics:
   - Locate a struct that has const generics as part of its definition. For example, `struct ConstChunksExact<'rem, T: 'a, const N: usize> {}` is the target.

4. Modify the const generic parameter within the struct:
   - Change the const parameter in the struct to a different identifier, say `M`, while ensuring that the original identifier `N` is still referenced somewhere in the struct or its implementations, such as its impl block or associated functions.

5. Implement the modified trait for a type, keeping the original const parameter:
   - Ensure that the implementation of the trait for a specific type (e.g., `[T]`) remains unchanged in its references to the const parameter (e.g., `N`) despite the changes made in the trait and struct definitions.

Example of Mutated Content:

Original:
```
trait ConstChunksExactTrait<T> {
    fn const_chunks_exact<const N: usize>(&self) -> ConstChunksExact<'a, T, { N }>;
}

struct ConstChunksExact<'rem, T: 'a, const N: usize> {}
```

Mutated:
```
trait ConstChunksExactTrait<T> {
    fn const_chunks_exact<const M: usize>(&self) -> ConstChunksExact<'a, T, { N }>;
}

struct ConstChunksExact<'rem, T: 'a, const M: usize> {}
```

By applying these modifications, the compiler's handling of mismatched const generic parameters is tested, potentially uncovering bugs related to const generic inference and usage within the Rust compiler's const generics implementation.
