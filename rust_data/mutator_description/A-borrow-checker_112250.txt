Mutation Operator

Target: Trait associated types with lifetimes and their implementation in structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition that includes an associated type with a lifetime constraint, such as `type Ty<'a> where Self: 'a;`.
2. In the implementation of this trait for a generic type, modify the associated type's definition to include a different lifetime constraint. Specifically, change the constraint to be a different, arbitrary lifetime that is not `'static`. 
3. Ensure that this modified lifetime is used consistently throughout the trait's implementation and in any struct that utilizes the trait, creating potential conflicts.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait Trait {
    type Ty<'a> where Self: 'a;
}

impl<T> Trait for T {
    type Ty<'a> = () where Self: 'a;
}
```

Mutation:
```rust
trait Trait {
    type Ty<'b> where Self: 'b;
}

impl<T> Trait for T {
    type Ty<'c> = () where Self: 'c;
}
```

The mutation changes the lifetime parameter in the trait definition and its implementation, potentially causing issues when the trait is used in contexts expecting the original lifetime constraint. This can lead to borrow checker complications, as the different lifetimes may not align correctly in more complex scenarios.
