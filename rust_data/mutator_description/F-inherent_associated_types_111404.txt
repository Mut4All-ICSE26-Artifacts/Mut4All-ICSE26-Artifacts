Mutation Operator: Alter Function Signature with Nested Associated Type

Target: Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function declaration in the seed program that involves associated types or lifetimes.
2. Identify if the function has any associated types being used as part of its signature.
3. Add or modify the use of inherent associated types in a nested manner within the function's signature, particularly aiming to create a deep nesting of associated types.
4. Ensure that this modification involves bound regions or lifetimes, which are more prone to triggering compiler issues.

Example:
Original Function Signature:
```
fn calculate(_: for<'b> fn(Container<fn(Container<fn(&'b ())>::Type)>::Type)) {}
```

Mutated Function Signature:
```
fn calculate(_: for<'b> fn(Container<fn(Container<fn(Container<fn(&'b ())>::Type)>::Type)>::Type)) {}
```

Explanation:
- The function signature is mutated by deepening the nesting of the associated type `Type` within the `Container` struct.
- This introduces more complexity in how the lifetimes and associated types are related and resolved, increasing the likelihood of triggering issues related to bound regions, as seen in the given bug report.  
- The focus is to introduce deeply nested associated types that involve the same lifetime parameter `'b`, emphasizing the relationship of bound regions and potential conflicts with `ReErased` lifetimes, as evident in the bug trace.
