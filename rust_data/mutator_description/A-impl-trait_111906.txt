Mutation Operator: Modify Lifetime Constraints in Function Return

Target: Apply to functions that return `impl Trait`, specifically when utilizing named lifetime parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that returns an `impl Trait`, such as `impl Sized`, and uses lifetime annotations in its signature.
2. Modify the lifetime constraints of the function to introduce mismatched or non-universal lifetime regions. For example, change the lifetime bounds to introduce a conflict or discrepancy.
3. In the function signature, add a conflicting or misaligned lifetime bound for the return type. For instance, if the function is `fn foo<'a>() -> impl Sized`, mutate it to `fn foo<'a>() -> impl Sized + 'static` or change the lifetime in the body to a different one, causing inconsistency.
4. Ensure that the body of the function attempts to instantiate or utilize the function in a way that conflicts with the modified lifetimes, potentially causing an ICE.

Example Pseudo-Code:
Original:
fn example<'a>() -> impl Trait {
    // Function body
}

Mutated:
fn example<'a>() -> impl Trait + 'static {
    // Function body where `example` is called with a conflicting lifetime
}

By modifying lifetime constraints this way, the intent is to explore how the Rust compiler handles non-universal lifetime regions in opaque type returns, potentially triggering a compiler bug or ICE.
