Mutation Operator: Adjust Lifetime Parameters in Trait Implementations

Target Code Construct: Trait method definitions and implementations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a method within a trait that includes lifetime parameters, e.g., `async fn foo<'a>(&self)` in a trait.
2. Locate the corresponding method implementation in a type that implements the trait, e.g., `impl MyTrait for i32`.
3. Remove or modify the lifetime parameter(s) in the method signature of the implementation to create a mismatch with the trait definition, e.g., change `async fn foo<'a>(&self)` to `async fn foo(&self)`.
4. Ensure that the trait method originally had a lifetime parameter, and its implementation does not match it after mutation.
5. This mutation should specifically focus on the use of lifetime parameters to trigger potential issues related to lifetime management in the compiler.

Example:
Given the trait:
```
trait MyTrait {
    async fn foo<'a>(&self);
}
```
And its implementation:
```
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async fn foo(&self) {}
}
```
Modify it to:
```
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async fn foo(&self) {} // Lifetime parameter removed
}
```

This type of mutation targets discrepancies in lifetime parameter usage between trait definitions and their implementations, which can trigger compiler errors or internal crashes related to lifetime substitution and validation.
