Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Definitions and Calls

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a function definition in the Rust code that includes const generics, constant parameters, or uses const functions within its constraints or body.

2. Locate a const function call within the constraints or body of the targeted function. In this context, the const function is used to derive a constant parameter for a trait bound or other purpose.

3. Replace the const function call with a direct constant value that is out of the expected range or context. The goal is to simulate a scenario that would cause the compiler to misinterpret the constant's origin or value.

4. Ensure the replaced constant value modifies the expected condition or logic. For instance, if the original const function call evaluates to a boolean, replace it with an integer to cause a type mismatch.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
trait Trait<const X: usize> {
    fn method();
}

const fn compute() -> usize {
    42
}

impl Trait<{ compute() }> for MyType {
    fn method() {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

Mutation Step:
- Replace `compute()` in the implementation with a constant value of a different type or unexpected value.
- Ensure the replacement creates a logical disconnect with the expected behavior or type.

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl Trait<{ 100 }> for MyType {
    fn method() {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

In this example, replacing `compute()` with `100` should create a scenario where the constant does not align with the logical or expected input for the trait, potentially triggering a compilation error or internal inconsistency in the compiler's interpretation of the const generics.
