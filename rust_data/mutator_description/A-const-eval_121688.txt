Mutation Operator: Introduce Generic Parameters to Function Signatures

Target Code Construct: Function definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition in the code. For example, locate a function like `fn example_function(param: Type) -> ReturnType { ... }`.
2. Modify the function by adding a generic parameter. Introduce a generic type parameter `<T>` before the function's argument list.
3. Replace the existing type of one of the function's parameters with this new generic type parameter `T`. Ensure that this generic type parameter is not used elsewhere in the function definition to maintain the mutation's simplicity.
4. If the function already has generic parameters, append the new generic type parameter `T` to the existing list.

Example:
Original Code:
```
fn process_data(data: i32) -> bool {
    data > 10
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn process_data<T>(data: T) -> bool {
    // Replace usage of data as necessary to match the logic with the new type T
    // This mutation focuses on causing compilation errors, so the function logic may need adjustment or conversion that leads to a type mismatch
    // The focus is on applying a new generic parameter to the function signature
    // For instance, trying to perform operations on T that are not defined for all types might lead to a compiler error or crash
    // In this example, data > 10 will lead to an error unless T implements specific traits
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to test the compiler's handling of generic types in functions, especially when the body of the function is not immediately compatible with the introduced generic type, increasing the chance of triggering type-checking errors or internal compiler errors (ICEs) during compilation.
