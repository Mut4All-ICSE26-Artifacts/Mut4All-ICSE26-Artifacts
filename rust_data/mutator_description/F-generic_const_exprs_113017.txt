Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Constant Expressions in Function Definitions

Target: Functions utilizing generic constant expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function that uses generic constant expressions within its constraints or body.
2. Identify the const generic parameters within the function's signature. For example, a function might have a const generic parameter like `for<const N: usize>`.
3. Alter the default value or the expression of the const generic parameter to an uncommon or complex expression. 
4. Ensure that the expression is syntactically correct but pushes the boundaries of what is typical or expected. For instance, change a simple default value to involve more complex operations or closures (e.g., `for<const N: usize = { |x| x + 1 }> V: 'a`).
5. Apply this change to all const generic parameters within the function's signature.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
pub fn example_function<T>(element)
where
    for<const N: usize = 5> T: 'a,
{}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
pub fn example_function<T>(element)
where
    for<const N: usize = { |x| x * 2 + 3 }> T: 'a,
{}
```

Rationale: Modifying generic constant expressions, especially by introducing closures or more intricate expressions, can stress-test the compiler's handling of constant evaluation and generics. This mutation is designed to explore the limits of generic const evaluation, potentially triggering edge cases or inconsistencies in compiler logic.
