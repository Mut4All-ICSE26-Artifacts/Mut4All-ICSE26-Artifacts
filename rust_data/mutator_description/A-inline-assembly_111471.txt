Mutation Operator: Modify Inline Assembly Operand

Target: Inline assembly statements using `asm!`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an inline assembly block in the Rust code. For example, `core::arch::asm!("global.get 0", "local.set {0}", out(local) ret);`.
2. Locate the operand within the inline assembly instruction, here represented as `"global.get 0"`.
3. Modify the operand to use another valid but distinct operand. For instance, change `"global.get 0"` to `"global.get 1"` or any other valid operand for the target architecture.
4. Ensure the modified operand still conforms to the syntax and semantics expected by the target architecture's assembly language.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
core::arch::asm!("global.get 0", "local.set {0}", out(local) ret);
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
core::arch::asm!("global.get 1", "local.set {0}", out(local) ret);
```

By modifying the operand of the inline assembly instruction, this mutation operator aims to explore how the Rust compiler handles variations in assembly instructions and their effects on code generation. The mutation is simple yet covers a wide range of potential issues related to inline assembly.
