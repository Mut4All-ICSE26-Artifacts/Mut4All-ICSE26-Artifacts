Mutation Operator: Introduce Unstable Library Feature Without Feature Attribute

Target Code Construct: Use statements with unstable library features

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator targets code that imports items from the standard library or other crates that rely on unstable features which require enabling specific feature gates. The mutation involves intentionally removing the required feature attributes from the crate attributes, which are necessary to use the unstable items.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a use statement in the seed program that imports items relying on an unstable feature. For example, if the seed program includes `use std::ops::{FromResidual, Try};` and requires `#![feature(try_trait_v2)]`, target this use statement.
2. Ensure that the corresponding feature attribute that enables the use of the unstable feature is removed or commented out from the crate attributes. For instance, remove `#![feature(try_trait_v2)]` if it exists.
3. Compile the code to trigger compiler behavior related to unresolved or unsupported unstable features, which can lead to various errors or compiler crashes.

Example:
Original Code Snippet:
```rust
#![feature(try_trait_v2)]

use std::ops::{FromResidual, Try};

// Additional code here...
```

Mutated Code Snippet:
```rust
// Removed the feature attribute
// #![feature(try_trait_v2)]

use std::ops::{FromResidual, Try};

// Additional code here...
```

This mutation can lead to errors regarding the use of unstable library features without the proper feature attribute being enabled, which is a common source of issues when dealing with nightly Rust features.
