Mutation Operator: Function Signature with Lifetime Constraints

This mutation operator targets functions with generic parameters and lifetime constraints. It aims to modify function signatures by introducing or altering lifetime specifications. This can affect how lifetimes are resolved in the presence of trait bounds, potentially exposing bugs related to lifetime handling in the Rust compiler's trait system.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a generic parameter that includes a lifetime constraint. The function should have a trait bound involving a lifetime.
2. Introduce a new lifetime parameter or modify an existing one in the function signature. Ensure that the change affects the trait bounds.
3. Adjust the function body to use the new or modified lifetime parameter.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn process_data<F>(f: F) where F: for<'a> FnOnce(&'a u8) {
    <F as FnOnce(&u8)>::call_once(f, &0)
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn process_data<F>(f: F) where F: for<'b> FnOnce(&'b u8) {
    <F as FnOnce(&u8)>::call_once(f, &0)
}
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, the function `process_data` has a generic parameter `F` with a trait bound that includes a lifetime `'a`.
- The mutation introduces a new lifetime `'b` instead of `'a`, altering the lifetime constraint in the trait bound.
- This change can trigger issues in how the compiler resolves lifetimes in relation to the trait bounds, potentially leading to an internal compiler error (ICE).
