Mutation Operator: Modify Const Trait Implementation

Target Code Construct: Trait implementation for a struct, specifically involving const trait implementations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that is implemented with the `const` keyword for a struct. Note the method(s) within this trait implementation.
2. In the method implementation body, introduce a conditional compilation attribute to guard certain parts of the method logic.
3. Use existing variables or methods where applicable, and if introducing a new element, ensure it's properly declared within the scope.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the trait implementation that uses `const`, e.g., `impl const Foo for Const`.
- Choose a function within this implementation, e.g., `fn foo() -> u8`.
- Introduce a conditional compilation attribute, such as `#[cfg(feature = "test")]`, around a part of the method body to compile differently based on configuration.
- For example, wrap the computation or a part of the computation:
  ```rust
  #[cfg(feature = "test")]
  {
      // Existing code protected by the conditional compilation
      <Self as Bar>::bar() * 6
  }
  ```
- Ensure that the `cfg` feature is not defined in the testing environment to introduce a potential path for inconsistencies.

Example (pseudo-code):
Original:
```rust
impl const Foo for Const {
    fn foo() -> u8
    where
        Self: ~const Bar,
    {
        <Self as Bar>::bar() * 6
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl const Foo for Const {
    fn foo() -> u8
    where
        Self: ~const Bar,
    {
        #[cfg(feature = "test")]
        {
            <Self as Bar>::bar() * 6
        }
    }
}
```

This mutation operator exploits potential inconsistencies in handling of `const` trait implementations when conditional compilation is used, which could lead to unexpected compiler behavior.
