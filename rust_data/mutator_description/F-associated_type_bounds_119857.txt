Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Associated Type Bounds

Target Construct: Trait and its associated type

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that includes an associated type with a bound (e.g., `type Item<'a>: 'a;`).
2. Modify the bound of the associated type to add additional or alternative lifetime or trait constraints. This can influence the compiler's handling of associated types and their constraints, potentially triggering unexpected behaviors.
3. Example Mutation:
   - Original: `type Item<'a>: 'a;`
   - Mutation: `type Item<'a>: 'a + 'static;` or `type Item<'a>: Clone + 'a;`

Explanation:
This mutation targets the trait's associated type definition, specifically where bounds are declared. By altering the bounds, the mutation can stress test the Rust compiler's handling of lifetime and trait constraints, which is a common area where bugs might occur, especially in complex generic and lifetime resolutions. This helps in identifying weaknesses in the compiler's trait system handling.
