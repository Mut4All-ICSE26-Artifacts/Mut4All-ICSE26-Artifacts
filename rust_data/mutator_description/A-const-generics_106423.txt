Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Parameters in Functions

This mutation operator targets functions that utilize const generics. It specifically applies to function definitions using const generics, where type parameters are defined with constant values. The mutation involves altering the const generic arguments in function calls to values that may cause inconsistencies or unexpected behavior during compilation, potentially triggering compiler bugs.

1. Identify a function in the seed program that uses const generics. For instance, consider a function definition like the following:

```rust
fn example_function<T, const N: usize>(param: [T; N]) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

2. Locate a call to this function, which might look like:

```rust
example_function::<i32, 4>([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

3. Modify the const generic argument to a value that is either larger than expected or incompatible with the context. For instance, change the argument `4` to `usize::MAX` or a similar boundary value:

```rust
example_function::<i32, usize::MAX>([1, 2, 3, 4]);  // Potentially triggers a bug
```

4. Ensure that the mutated argument does not exceed the array's length or the intended use, as this might introduce runtime errors that are separate from the const generics issue. The goal is to focus on causing a compilation inconsistency due to the const generic system.

By following this mutation pattern, the operator leverages the Rust compiler's handling of const generics, which is a complex area and prone to triggering inconsistencies or internal compiler errors (ICEs) when unexpected values are utilized.
