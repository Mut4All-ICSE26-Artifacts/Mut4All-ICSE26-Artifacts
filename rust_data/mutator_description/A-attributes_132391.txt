Mutation Operator

Target: Function definition within traits

Mutation Rule: Modify the `#[repr(align(N))]` attribute in a function within a trait definition to include an invalid or missing alignment value, which should result in a compiler error related to attribute handling.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a trait definition in the seed program that contains a function.
2. If the function already has attributes, locate the `#[repr(...)]` attribute. If it does not exist, introduce it.
3. Modify or add the `#[repr(align(N))]` attribute without specifying a valid alignment value. For example, use `#[repr(align)]` without an `N` or use an invalid value.
4. Ensure that this mutation is applied to a function within the trait itself, not outside or in implementations.

Example before mutation:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    fn example_function();
}
```

Example after mutation:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    #[repr(align)]
    fn example_function();
}
```

This mutation operator targets potential issues with attribute handling in the compiler, particularly focusing on improper or incomplete usage of `#[repr(align(...))]` within trait function definitions.
