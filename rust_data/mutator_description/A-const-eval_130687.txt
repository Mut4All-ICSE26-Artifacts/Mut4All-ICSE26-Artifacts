Mutation Operator: Modify Array Size in Struct Definition

Target: Struct Definitions with Array Fields

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition with an array field in the seed program. The array should have a constant size.
2. Select the constant size expression of the array, particularly if it involves any computation or constant evaluation.
3. Alter the expression to include a division or modulo with a large constant that may cause a const-eval failure due to potential for an overflow or excessive memory allocation.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct Example {
    data: [u8; 1024]
}
```

Mutation:
1. Locate the array size expression `1024` in the struct definition.
2. Modify the size expression by introducing a division with a large constant, like so: `[u8; 1024 / (usize::MAX >> 16)]`.

Transformed Code:
```rust
struct Example {
    data: [u8; 1024 / (usize::MAX >> 16)]
}
```

This mutation operator leverages potential const-eval issues related to excessive memory allocation, similar to the issues seen in the bug report. It encourages the compiler to handle edge cases where the evaluation of constants could lead to unintended compiler behavior or crashes.
