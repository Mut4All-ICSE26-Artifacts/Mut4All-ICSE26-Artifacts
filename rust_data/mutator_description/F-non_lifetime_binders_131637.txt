Mutation Operator: Introduction of Nested `impl Trait` in Function Return

Target Code Construct: Function return type with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the Rust code that uses `impl Trait` in its return type.
2. Modify the return type to include a nested `impl Trait`. Specifically, replace the existing `impl Trait` with another `impl Trait` wrapped inside it.
3. Ensure that the nested `impl Trait` has a valid trait bound that is compatible with the original function's trait.

Example Mutation:
Original function:
```rust
fn example_method(&self) -> impl SomeTrait;
```

After mutation:
```rust
fn example_method(&self) -> impl AnotherTrait<impl SomeTrait>;
```

Explanation:
- This mutation targets functions that use `impl Trait` in their return type, a construction related to the bug report.
- By introducing nested `impl Trait`, it aligns with the bug report's context where similar complex trait structures led to issues.
- Adjust the nested trait (`AnotherTrait` in the example) to be compatible with the surrounding context of the function to maintain syntactical correctness.
