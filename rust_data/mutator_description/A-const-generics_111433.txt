Mutation Operator: Modify Const Function Return Type to Invalid Condition

Target: Const Function Declaration and Return Type

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `const fn` in the source code.
2. Locate the return type specified in the function signature (e.g., `-> usize`).
3. Alter the return type to introduce a nonsensical or invalid condition that logically would not hold true, such as `where &'a (): !Sized` instead of `where &'a (): Sized`.

Example:
Original Code:
```
const fn inner<'a>() -> usize where &'a (): Sized {
    3
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
const fn inner<'a>() -> usize where &'a (): !Sized {
    3
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the `const fn` declaration to modify the trait bound in the `where` clause to a logically incorrect condition, which is likely to trigger inconsistent behavior or compiler errors, especially in const-generics contexts. This can be effective in testing the robustness of the Rust compiler's handling of trait bounds in constant expressions.
