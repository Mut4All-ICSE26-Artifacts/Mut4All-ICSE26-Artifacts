Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Pattern to Trigger Delim Mismatch

Target: Macro definitions.

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator targets macro definitions, specifically the delineation of macro patterns and their expansion. The mutation changes the delimiters used in the macro pattern and expansion to mismatched ones, which are likely to cause issues similar to the "Mismatched open/close delims" error observed in the bug report.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a macro definition within the seed program. For example, locate a macro defined using `macro_rules!`.

2. Focus on the pattern or expansion part where delimiters are used. These could be braces `{}`, brackets `[]`, or parentheses `()`.

3. Introduce a mismatch in the delimiters. For instance, if the macro pattern begins with a brace `{`, attempt to close it with a parenthesis `)` or a bracket `]`.

Example:
Original Macro:
```
macro_rules! example_macro {
    ($x:expr) => {
        { println!("{}", $x); }
    };
}
```

Mutated Macro:
```
macro_rules! example_macro {
    ($x:expr) => {
        ( println!("{}", $x); }
    };
}
```

Note: The change introduces a mismatched delimiter in the macro expansion. This alteration in the structure of the macro is aimed at triggering parsing errors or internal compiler errors (ICEs) associated with delimiter mismatches. By focusing on existing macros and slightly altering their pattern, we can increase the likelihood of encountering bugs similar to those documented in the issue report. The mutation should make use of existing code structures to maintain relevance to the seed program.
