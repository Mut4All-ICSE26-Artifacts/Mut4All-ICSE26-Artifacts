Mutation Operator 1: Modify Associated Type with Default Implementation

Target: This operator applies to associated types within traits that are implemented with a default implementation block.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait with an associated type and a default implementation block. For instance, locate an unsafe trait with an associated type, such as `Storage` with `type Handle`.
2. Modify the default implementation block to add a constraint on the associated type using a generic bound. For example, if the associated type is `Handle`, add a constraint like `where Self::Handle: SomeTrait`.
3. Ensure the trait used in the constraint (`SomeTrait`) is already defined or declare it if not available in the seed program. If a new trait must be declared, define it as a simple trait, e.g., `trait SomeTrait {}`.
4. Adjust any functions or methods using the associated type to accommodate the new constraint, ensuring they still compile under the new rules.

Example:
Original:
```rust
pub unsafe trait Storage {
    type Handle;
}

default unsafe impl<S> Storage for S
where
    S: MultipleStorage,
{
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
pub unsafe trait Storage {
    type Handle;
}

trait SomeTrait {}

default unsafe impl<S> Storage for S
where
    S: MultipleStorage,
    S::Handle: SomeTrait,
{
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to interact with the Rust compilerâ€™s handling of associated types in combination with traits and default implementations. By introducing constraints on associated types in default implementations, we can potentially trigger compiler bugs related to specialization and type projection handling.
