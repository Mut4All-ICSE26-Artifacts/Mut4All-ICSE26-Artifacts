Mutation Operator: Modify `impl Trait` Return Type in Function

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets functions that utilize `impl Trait` return types, especially those involved in recursive type definitions or interactions with traits.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that returns `impl Trait`. In the given bug report, this is `fn one() -> impl Handler`.
2. Modify the return type to a specific type that meets the trait bounds instead of using `impl Trait`. This involves determining the concrete type currently being hidden by `impl Trait` and directly returning that type.
3. Ensure the function's return statement matches the new return type.
4. If the original `impl Trait` return type was recursive (e.g., a tuple with the function itself), replace it with a non-recursive structure to simplify type resolution for the compiler.

Example in Pseudo-code:
Original Function:
```
fn one() -> impl Handler {
    (one,)
}
```

Modified Function:
```
fn one() -> (fn() -> impl Handler,) {
    (one,)
}

impl Handler for (fn() -> impl Handler,) {}
```

Explanation:
This mutation substitutes the `impl Handler` return with a concrete type that explicitly captures the intended structure without using `impl Trait`. The modification helps explore how the compiler manages concrete types versus `impl Trait`, which can aid in identifying issues related to type resolution and trait implementation, especially when recursion is involved.
