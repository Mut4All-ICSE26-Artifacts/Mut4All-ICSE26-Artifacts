Mutation Operator: Modify Transmutability Trait Bound

Target Code Construct: Function where clauses (trait bounds)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that has a trait bound involving transmutability, such as `Dst: BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<Src>`.
2. Alter this trait bound to use a different transmutability-related trait or modify the parameters to introduce a mismatch or conflict that would potentially lead to a compilation error or internal crash.
3. If the function does not initially include such a trait bound, add a transmutability-related trait bound with mismatched parameters.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub fn is_transmutable<Src, Dst>()
where
    Dst: BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<Src>,
{
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
pub fn is_transmutable<Src, Dst>()
where
    Dst: std::mem::Assume<Src>,  // Alter the transmutability-related trait to cause a potential conflict
{
}
```

In this mutation, we have changed the trait bound from `BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<Src>` to `std::mem::Assume<Src>`, which might not be a valid or compatible transmutability operation depending on the context, thus potentially triggering an ICE or other compiler error.
