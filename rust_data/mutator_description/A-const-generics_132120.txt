Mutation Operator: Add Explicit Type to Const Item

Target: Const Items within Functions

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify any const item within a function where the type is omitted. This can typically be found with the Rust syntax `const <IDENTIFIER> = <VALUE>;`.

2. Modify the const item by explicitly providing a type annotation. Determine an appropriate type based on the value assigned to the const item. If the value is numeric, a common choice is to use `i32` or `u32`, depending on whether the value can be negative.

3. Insert the type annotation immediately after the identifier in the const item declaration, using the following format: `const <IDENTIFIER>: <TYPE> = <VALUE>;`.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    const I = 0; // type omitted
    // Other code...
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    const I: i32 = 0; // type explicitly provided
    // Other code...
}
```

This mutation operator ensures that the const item has an explicit type, reducing the likelihood of triggering type-related compiler errors or ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors) related to omitted types in const generics.
