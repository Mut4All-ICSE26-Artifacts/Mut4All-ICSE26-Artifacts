Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Constant Expression in Struct Array

Target Structure: Struct with array fields using generic constants.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a struct definition that contains an array with a size defined by a constant generic expression. For example, `struct EntriesBuffer(Box<[[u8; HashesEntryLEN]; 5]>)`.
2. Alter the size of the array using an arithmetic operation involving a constant and an arithmetic expression. Ensure the expression remains within valid bounds of array sizes in Rust.
3. Modify only the constant expression without changing the type of elements within the array.

Example:
Original:
```
struct EntriesBuffer(Box<[[u8; HashesEntryLEN]; 5]>);
```

Mutated:
```
struct EntriesBuffer(Box<[[u8; HashesEntryLEN + 1]; 5]>);
```

In this mutation, the size `HashesEntryLEN` is increased by `1` using an arithmetic expression. This alteration is expected to trigger behavior changes in the compiler's handling of generic constant expressions, potentially exposing bugs related to size inference in arrays within structs.
