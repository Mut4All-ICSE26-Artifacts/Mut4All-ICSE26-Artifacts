Mutation Operator: Zero-Sized Array in Union

Target Construct: Union

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a union in the Rust code. For example, consider a union named `U` with fields `a` and `b`.
2. Locate a field within the union of a zero-sized array type (e.g., `[u16; 0]`).
3. Remove the zero-sized array field from the union.
4. Add a non-zero-sized array field to the union, ensuring it is of a type already declared in the program or a simple primitive type. For example, replace `[u16; 0]` with `[u16; 1]` or another field such as `u32`.
5. Ensure the rest of the code, including any function, struct, or type associated with the union, remains unchanged.

Example:
Original Union:
```rust
pub union U {
    a: [u16; 0],
    b: u8,
}
```

Mutated Union:
```rust
pub union U {
    a: [u16; 1], // Replaced zero-sized array with a non-zero-sized array
    b: u8,
}
```

This mutation operator leverages the tendency of the Rust compiler to have issues with zero-sized arrays in unions, focusing on replacing such elements to trigger layout and transmutability logic paths that are less commonly tested but highly impactful.
