Mutation Operator: Introduce Unstable Feature Misuse

Target: Enum Definitions with Custom Discriminants

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing enum in the seed program. Ensure the enum has variants with custom discriminants.
2. If the enum does not have custom discriminants, add one for each variant using non-consecutive integers or negative numbers.
3. Introduce the `#![feature(arbitrary_enum_discriminant)]` attribute at the top of the file to enable the use of arbitrary discriminant values.
4. In the same or another enum definition, introduce an unstable feature and use it improperly, such as adding a variant with a never type (`!`) without enabling the required feature.
5. Ensure that the enum with the never type variant is used in a transmutation context or another context where the compiler's type checking and const evaluation might be triggered.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
enum Example {
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
#![feature(arbitrary_enum_discriminant)]

enum Example {
    A = 1,
    B = -3,
}

enum Faulty {
    C = 0,
    D(!),
}

// Use the `Faulty` enum in a way that requires type checking or const eval.
fn usage() {
    let _ = Faulty::D; // Improper use of `!` type causes instability
}
```

Explanation: This mutation targets enum definitions with custom discriminants and introduces misuse of unstable features. By leveraging improper use of the `!` type in conjunction with custom discriminants and unstable features, the mutation is designed to trigger compiler bugs related to const evaluation and type checking logic. This operator modifies both the structure of enum definitions and the usage contexts, increasing the likelihood of triggering edge cases in the compiler.
