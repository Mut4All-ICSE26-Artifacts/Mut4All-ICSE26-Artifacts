Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Expression

Target: Function Signature

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a const generic expression in its where clause.
2. Locate the expression used for the const generic parameter definition, such as `{ T::<0>::A as u8 + T::<0>::B as u8 }`.
3. Replace the const generic expression with a different arithmetic operation or introduce a logical operation involving existing types or functions.
4. Ensure the new expression still uses the same const generic parameter but changes the internal calculation logic.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn foo<T>() where for<const N: u8 = { T::<0>::A as u8 + T::<0>::B as u8 }> T: TraitA<'a, AsA: for<'b> TraitB<'a, 'b, AsB: for<'c> TraitC<'a, 'b, 'c>>> {}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn foo<T>() where for<const N: u8 = { T::<0>::A as u8 * 2 - T::<0>::B as u8 }> T: TraitA<'a, AsA: for<'b> TraitB<'a, 'b, AsB: for<'c> TraitC<'a, 'b, 'c>>> {}
```

Explanation:
This mutation changes the arithmetic operation in the const generic expression by replacing the addition with multiplication followed by subtraction. This helps uncover potential issues in the compiler related to handling complex expressions in const generics.
