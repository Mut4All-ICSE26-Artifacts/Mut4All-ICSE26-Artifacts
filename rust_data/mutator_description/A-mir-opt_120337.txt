Mutation Operator: Alter Function Return Types

Target: Function definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program with a specified return type, especially functions that return `Result<T, E>`, `Option<T>`, or other wrapper types.
2. Modify the return type of the function to return a different combination of these wrappers to observe how the change in type affects the compiler's interpretation and MIR (Mid-level Intermediate Representation) optimization.
3. Specifically, introduce a nested wrapper, or change the wrapping order, to create a potential inconsistency that might trigger a bug. 

Example Transformation:
Original Code:
```rust
fn example_function() -> Result<(), ()> {
    Ok(())
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn example_function() -> Result<Option<()>, ()> {
    Ok(Some(()))
}
```

Explanation:
By changing the return type from `Result<(), ()>` to `Result<Option<()>, ()>`, we introduce an additional layer of complexity. This transformation might lead the MIR optimization process to encounter unexpected states, potentially exposing latent bugs in the compiler's handling of nested types and their associated projections or downcasts.
