Mutation Operator

Target: Closure inside functions

Mutation Rule: Introduce a nested closure that captures a variable from its enclosing closure, simulating a situation with multiple layers of variable captures. This may stress the compiler's handling of closures and variable capturing mechanisms.

Steps:
1. Identify a closure within a function in the seed program. For example, within a function `fn example() { let _ = |var| {}; }`, identify the closure `|var| {}`.

2. Within the identified closure, introduce a nested closure that captures one of the variables from the enclosing closure. For example, within the closure `|var| {}`, add another closure like `|nested_var| { var + nested_var; }`.

3. Ensure that the nested closure captures the variable in a way that involves operations, such as arithmetic or method calls, that require access to the captured variable. In the example, `var + nested_var` ensures that `var` is actively captured.

4. Additionally, you might want to introduce interactions between asynchronous constructs and these closures if applicable, such as using `async` blocks within the nested closure.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn example() {
    let closure1 = |x| {
        let result = x + 1;
    };
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn example() {
    let closure1 = |x| {
        let nested_closure = |y| {
            x + y
        };
        nested_closure(2);
    };
}
```

This mutation introduces complications in variable capturing which can uncover bugs in how the compiler handles closures, especially when they are nested or have complex capture conditions.
