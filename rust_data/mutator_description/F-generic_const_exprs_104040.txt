Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Constant Expressions in Traits

Target: Generic constants in trait implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that has a constant generic parameter, such as `const N: usize`, within its definition.
2. Locate the implementation of this trait for a specific struct or type, such as `impl Print<L> for Printer {}`.
3. Alter the constant parameter by introducing a nested arithmetic expression within its implementation. The expression should still resolve to the original constant value but in a more complex manner, such as using basic arithmetic operations.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub trait Print<const N: usize> {
    fn print(&self) -> usize {
        N
    }
}

pub struct Printer;
impl Print<L> for Printer {}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
pub trait Print<const N: usize> {
    fn print(&self) -> usize {
        N
    }
}

pub struct Printer;
impl Print<{2 + 2}> for Printer {}
```

Explanation:
- In the original code, the trait `Print` is implemented for a struct `Printer` using a constant `L`.
- The mutation introduces an arithmetic expression `{2 + 2}` as the constant generic argument in place of `L`.
- This mutation targets scenarios where the Rust compiler may struggle with resolving expressions within constant generic parameters, potentially triggering internal compiler errors (ICEs) in the constant evaluation logic.
