Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method Self Type with Additional Traits

Target: Trait method signature in the context of `async` functions and `arbitrary_self_types`.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait with an `async` method that uses `self` with a type bound having multiple traits.
2. Add an additional trait constraint to the `self` parameter type.
3. Use existing traits or introduce a new trait if none are available within the existing code scope.

Example:

Original:
```rust
pub trait Example {
    async fn action(self: &(impl Trait1 + Trait2), param: Type);
}
```

Mutation Steps:

1. Extend the `self` type constraint by adding another trait, e.g., `Trait3`.
2. The new trait should either be an existing trait already used in the code or a simple new trait defined as follows:
   ```rust
   pub trait Trait3 {}
   ```

Mutated:
```rust
pub trait Example {
    async fn action(self: &(impl Trait1 + Trait2 + Trait3), param: Type);
}
```

Note: Ensure `Trait3` is defined within the codebase or replace it with a suitable existing trait that fits the context of the program. If introducing a new trait, declare it in the same module or context where it can be accessed without causing compilation errors unrelated to the intended mutation.
