Mutation Operator: Alter Trait Bounds in Generic Functions

Target: Generic functions with trait bounds

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a where clause specifying trait bounds. This function should also involve generic types and potentially associated types.
2. Within the where clause, introduce an additional, potentially conflicting, trait bound for the generic type. Use existing traits or related traits to increase likelihood of conflict.
3. Ensure that the new trait bound uses an associated type or a lifetime parameter that is not compatible with the existing bounds.

Example:
Original Function:
```rust
fn foo<T>() where T: TraitA<'a, AsA: for<'b> TraitB<'a, 'b>> {}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Identify the generic type `T` in the function's where clause.
2. Introduce a new trait bound using an existing trait, such as `TraitC`, with incompatible lifetime or associated type parameters.
3. Ensure the new bound has a potentially conflicting configuration with the existing bounds.

Mutated Function:
```rust
fn foo<T>() where T: TraitA<'a, AsA: for<'b> TraitB<'a, 'b>>, T: for<'c> TraitC<'c> {}
```

This operator exploits potential inconsistencies in the handling of trait bounds and associated types, aiming to trigger compiler bugs related to trait resolution or bound checking.
