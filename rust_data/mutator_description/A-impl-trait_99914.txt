Mutation Operator: Asynchronous Function and Await Misplacement

Target Code Construct: Asynchronous functions and the use of the `.await` keyword

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an asynchronous function call within a function (e.g., within `foo` function).
2. Remove the `.await` keyword from the asynchronous function call.
3. Move the `.await` keyword to a location where it is not syntactically valid, such as following an operation that returns a non-async type.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn foo() {
    let initial_exchange: Result<usize, Error> = todo!();
    initial_exchange.and_then(|_| serve_udp_tunnel()).await;
}

async fn serve_udp_tunnel() {}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn foo() {
    let initial_exchange: Result<usize, Error> = todo!();
    initial_exchange.and_then(|_| serve_udp_tunnel());
    initial_exchange.await; // Misplaced await
}

async fn serve_udp_tunnel() {}
```

In this mutation, the `.await` is removed from the `serve_udp_tunnel()` call and mistakenly placed after a non-async result, which is meant to trigger potential bugs related to improper async handling. This mutation operator focuses on mismanaging the `.await` placement, which is a common source of errors in asynchronous Rust programming.
