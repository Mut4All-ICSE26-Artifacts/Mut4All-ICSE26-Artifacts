Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Default Type Constraint

Target: Trait implementation with default type specialization.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation with a default type, such as in the impl block of a trait.
2. Introduce a constraint to the default type using an existing type or a new type. For example, if the default type is `Vec<Self>`, constrain it to `Vec<Self> where Self: SomeTrait`.
3. If the constraint requires a new trait or type, declare it explicitly. Ensure that the new trait or type is simple and does not introduce additional dependencies.
4. Apply the constraint in a way that the compiler must verify the default type's compliance with the constraint.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl<C> SpecTrait for C {
    default type Assoc = Vec<Self>;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait SomeTrait {}

impl<C: SomeTrait> SpecTrait for C {
    default type Assoc = Vec<Self>;
}
```

Steps:
- Introduce a new trait `SomeTrait`.
- Modify the existing impl block to include a constraint `C: SomeTrait`.
- Ensure that the compilation involves verification of the constraint `C: SomeTrait`.

This mutation specifically targets the interaction between trait constraints and default type specialization, potentially triggering bugs related to specialization and trait bounds checking.
