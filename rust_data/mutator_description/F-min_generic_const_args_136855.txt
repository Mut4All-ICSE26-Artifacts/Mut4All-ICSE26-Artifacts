Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Const Generics

Target: The implementation block for a trait that uses const generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an implementation (`impl`) block in the Rust code where a trait is implemented for a concrete type and involves the use of const generics.
2. If the implementation block uses an array type with a const generic parameter, such as `[Type; const_param]`, replace the const parameter with a function name from the existing code (or introduce a new private function if none are available).
3. Ensure that the introduced function has no parameters and returns a value of the required type (e.g., `usize` for array sizes).
4. Make sure the function used is defined before the `impl` block in the code.

Example Mutation:
Original:
```rust
impl A<[usize; N]> for MyStruct {}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn my_function() -> usize {
    42 // Arbitrary example value
}

impl A<[usize; my_function]> for MyStruct {}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation targets the use of const generics in trait implementations, particularly when used as array sizes.
- By replacing the const parameter with a function call, the mutation tests the compiler's handling of const generic arguments that should be resolved at compile time.
- The mutation uses existing functions from the codebase or introduces a new simple function to replace the const parameter, aiming to trigger potential compiler bugs related to const evaluation and usage.
