Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Definition to Use Undefined Constants

Target Construct: Macro Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a macro definition in the seed program. For example, `macro_rules! make { () => { 1000 } }`.
2. Modify the macro definition to use an undefined constant instead of a literal. This constant should not be declared anywhere within the program. 
3. Replace the literal value within the macro with this undefined constant.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Identify the macro definition. For example: 
  ```rust
  #[macro_export]
  macro_rules! make { () => { 1000 } }
  ```
- Introduce an undefined constant name, such as `UNDEFINED_CONST`. Ensure this constant is not declared or initialized anywhere in the program.
- Modify the macro body to use `UNDEFINED_CONST` instead of the literal value `1000`:
  ```rust
  #[macro_export]
  macro_rules! make { () => { UNDEFINED_CONST } }
  ```

Rationale: This mutation operator targets the macro system in Rust, which is a complex part of the Rust compilation process. By introducing an undefined constant, it challenges the compiler's ability to handle unresolved identifiers in the macro expansion phase, potentially triggering latent bugs related to linting or error reporting mechanisms.
