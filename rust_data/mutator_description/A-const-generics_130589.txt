Mutation Operator: Alter Usage of Macros with Const Generics

Target Construct: Struct definition using const generics, specifically where a macro is utilized within the generic parameter.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that uses const generics and a macro within the generic parameter definition. For example:
   
   ```rust
   struct Example<const N: usize>(Wrapper<{ macro!(N) }>);
   ```

2. Introduce a new layer of macro wrapping around the existing macro invocation within the const generic definition. This involves:
   - Creating a new macro that wraps another macro call.
   - Modifying the struct definition to use the newly created macro.

3. Apply the following transformation:
   - Define a new macro that simply calls another macro:
     ```rust
     macro_rules! outer_wrap {
         ($x:expr) => {
             macro!($x)
         };
     }
     ```

   - Alter the struct definition to use the new macro:
     ```rust
     struct Example<const N: usize>(Wrapper<{ outer_wrap!(N) }>);
     ```

Explanation:
By introducing an additional layer of macro wrapping around a const generic parameter, the mutation operator seeks to stress the Rust compiler's handling of macro expansions in the context of const generics, which is a known fragile area, as indicated by the bug report. This can potentially lead to internal compiler errors or unexpected behavior. The mutation specifically targets the interplay between macros and const generics, exploiting the complexity that arises from nested macro calls within const contexts.
