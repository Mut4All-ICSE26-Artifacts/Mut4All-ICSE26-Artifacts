Mutation Operator: Altering Macro Invocation with Complex Path

Target: This mutation operator targets macro invocations with a path as an argument.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a macro invocation where a path is passed as an argument. The macro should be defined using `macro_rules!` and should take a syntactic structure like `$attr_path: path`.
2. Modify the path argument by introducing a block of code or an expression that creates a nested scope. This can be done by using a closure or an inline block.
3. Ensure that the block of code or expression uses variables, types, or functions that are already declared in the scope where the macro is invoked. If new variables are introduced within the block, they must be declared and used meaningfully within the block itself.

Example:
Original Macro Invocation:
```rust
m!(some_module::some_function);
```

Mutated Macro Invocation:
```rust
m!(some_module::some_function<{
    let temp_var = existing_function();
    another_existing_function(temp_var)
}>);
```

Explanation:
- The original path `some_module::some_function` is altered by embedding it within a block `{}`.
- Within the block, `temp_var` is introduced as a new variable. It is initialized by calling an `existing_function()`, which should already be available in the program's context.
- The `another_existing_function(temp_var)` call further uses `temp_var`, ensuring that the mutation is semantically robust and does not lead to undeclared usage issues.
- This mutation exploits the complexity of non-standard path expressions in macro invocations, which can reveal edge cases in the compiler's macro expansion and path resolution mechanisms, potentially leading to crashes similar to the reported bug.
