Mutation Operator: Modify Closure Usage

Target: Closure expressions within the code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a closure expression in the seed Rust program.
2. Identify the lifetime annotations being used with the closure (e.g., `for<'a>`).
3. Modify the closure by removing the lifetime annotations, i.e., replace `for<'a>` with an empty `for<>`, or remove the entire `for<...>` construct if it is directly affecting closure parameters or return types.
4. Ensure that the closure parameters and return types are modified to reflect the absence of the lifetime annotations, i.e., remove `'a` from the parameter and return type.
5. Validate that the modified closure still adheres to Rust's syntax rules but is likely to trigger issues with lifetime resolution.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn bar() {
    let closure = for<'b> |x: &'b u32| -> &'b u32 {
        *x
    };
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
fn bar() {
    let closure = |x: &u32| -> &u32 {
        *x
    };
}
```

Note: This mutation operator targets the way Rust handles lifetimes in closures. Removing or modifying lifetime annotations can expose underlying issues in the Rust compiler's handling of lifetime resolution and borrow checking, potentially triggering bugs similar to those seen in the bug report.
