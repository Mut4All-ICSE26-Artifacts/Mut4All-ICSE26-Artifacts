Mutation Operator 1: Inline Const Mutation in Struct Initialization

Target: Applies to structs with associated functions utilizing inline const expressions for initialization.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that has an associated function or method utilizing inline const for initialization.
2. Within the const block of the function, modify the initialization of one of the fields to use a different approach such as introducing an intermediate variable or directly calling a function that returns the required value.
3. Ensure that any unsafe operations within the block are still valid or adjusted accordingly to maintain safety.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
pub struct ExampleStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl ExampleStruct {
    pub fn new() -> &'static Self {
        const {
            &ExampleStruct {
                value: compute_value(),
            }
        }
    }
}

fn compute_value() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
pub struct ExampleStruct {
    value: i32,
}

impl ExampleStruct {
    pub fn new() -> &'static Self {
        const {
            let temp_value = compute_value();
            &ExampleStruct {
                value: temp_value,
            }
        }
    }
}

fn compute_value() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation introduces an intermediate variable `temp_value` within the inline const block before assigning it to the struct's field during initialization. 
- This approach might expose issues with the handling of temporary variables within const contexts or the interaction of inline const with function calls.
