Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Bounds in Function Definitions

Target: Rust function definitions using const generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that uses const generics, e.g., `fn my_function<const N: usize>(...)`.
2. Introduce a new condition that could potentially lead to constraints or conflicts with existing logic. 
3. Specifically, replace a simple comparison or condition with a more complex logical expression involving multiple const generics.
4. Ensure this logical expression involves arithmetic operations, logical AND (`&&`), or logical OR (`||`).

Example:

Original function:
```rust
fn compute<const N: usize>(values: [i32; N]) -> i32 {
    // Function logic
}
```

Mutated function:
```rust
fn compute<const N: usize, const M: usize>(values: [i32; N]) -> i32 
where
    M: std::ops::Add<Output = usize>,
    [i32; M + N]: Sized,
{
    // Function logic
}
```

Explanation:
By introducing additional const generics (`M`) and using them in a complex expression (`M + N`), we increase the potential for the compiler to encounter unexpected interactions or constraints, particularly when the const generics are manipulated in ways that might lead to new types or conditions. This mutated pattern is more likely to trigger issues related to const generics handling in the compiler.
