Mutation Operator

Target: Macro invocations within function bodies.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify macro invocations within a function in the seed program. The macro should take statements (e.g., `$foo:stmt`) as parameters.
2. Replace one of the macro parameters with a different statement that modifies control flow or introduces a function call. 
3. Ensure the statement used in the mutation is compatible with the macro definition. 
4. Example: If a macro is invoked as `macro_name!(stmt1; stmt2;)`, replace `stmt1` with a statement like `return;` or `some_function();` that affects control flow or uses a function call.

Pseudo-Code Example:
Original:
```
macro_rules! example_macro {
    ($a:stmt; $b:stmt;) => {
        $a
        $b
    };
}

fn demo_function() {
    example_macro!(println!("Hello, world!"); println!("Goodbye, world!"););
}
```

Mutated:
```
fn demo_function() {
    example_macro!(return; println!("Goodbye, world!"););
}
```

Rationale:
The mutation changes the behavior of the macro invocation by altering the control flow within the macro expansion, which can trigger unexpected behaviors or compiler crashes related to statement handling and parsing.
