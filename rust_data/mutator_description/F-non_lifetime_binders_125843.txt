Mutation Operator: Modify Trait and Function Bound Syntax

Target Code Construct: Function with generic bounds and trait implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition with complex generic bounds and trait implementations, especially those using `impl` trait and lifetime parameters.
2. Modify the trait bound syntax by introducing unnecessary complexity or incorrect syntax. Specifically, focus on the areas where generic parameters and lifetimes are used within the bounds.
3. Replace existing lifetimes with new, erroneous lifetime specifications or add redundant lifetime parameters that are not used.

Example Mutation:
Original:
```
fn example_fn<T: Trait + 'a, U>(arg: T, val: U) -> impl Trait + 'a {}
```

Mutation:
```
fn example_fn<T: Trait + 'a, U: 'static>(arg: T, val: U) -> impl Trait + 'a + 'static {}
```

Explanation:
- Introduce a redundant lifetime `'static` to the return type and the second generic parameter `U`.
- This adds complexity to the trait bounds and can potentially confuse the Rust compiler, especially when it tries to resolve lifetimes and bindings.
