Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Constant Expressions in Function Signature

Target Structure: Function signature with generic constant expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that uses generic constant expressions, such as `fn foo<const N: usize>(...)`.
2. Select the constant expression within the function signature, specifically in the array size or other constraints, like `N` in `[u8; N]`.
3. Modify the expression to include an arithmetic operation that combines the constant with itself, such as `N + N`.
4. Ensure the modified expression is still a valid constant expression but may push the limits of the compiler's evaluation, such as `[u8; N + N]`.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn example_function<const N: usize>(_: [u8; N]) {}
```

Mutation:
```rust
fn example_function<const N: usize>(_: [u8; N + N]) {}
```

This mutation tests the compiler's ability to handle more complex constant evaluations involving arithmetic operations in generic contexts.
