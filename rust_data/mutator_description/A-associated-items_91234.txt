Mutation Operator: Modify Associated Type Constraints in Traits

Target Code Construct: Trait definitions and their associated types, specifically where type constraints are defined.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that defines an associated type with a constraint, such as `type Type: SomeTrait;`.
2. Modify the constraint on the associated type by replacing it with a different trait or adding an additional trait bound. For example, change `type Type: SomeTrait;` to `type Type: OtherTrait;` or `type Type: SomeTrait + AnotherTrait;`.
3. Ensure that the new trait(s) used as constraints are either already implemented for the types in the seed program or can be trivially implemented.
4. If necessary, add a trivial implementation of the new trait(s) to ensure the mutation is valid within the context of the seed program. For example:

```rust
trait SomeTrait {}
trait OtherTrait {}
trait AnotherTrait {}

struct SomeType;
impl SomeTrait for SomeType {}

// Original trait with associated type
trait ExampleTrait {
    type Type: SomeTrait;
}

// Mutated trait with modified constraint
trait ExampleTrait {
    type Type: OtherTrait;
}

// Or with an additional constraint
trait ExampleTrait {
    type Type: SomeTrait + AnotherTrait;
}
```

This mutation operator modifies the way associated types are constrained within traits, which can lead to compiler errors or crashes if the constraints are not appropriately handled by the compiler's normalization process. By changing or adding constraints, the mutation can expose areas where the compiler may have incomplete handling of trait bounds or normalization logic.
