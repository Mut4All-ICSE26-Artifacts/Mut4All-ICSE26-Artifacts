Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Arguments in Struct Instantiation

Target: Struct instantiation with generic arguments

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a struct instantiation in the seed program that takes generic arguments. The struct should have a specified number of expected generic parameters.
2. Modify the number of generic arguments passed to the struct by adding an extra, unnecessary generic argument.
3. Ensure that the modification does not introduce undeclared types or variables; use existing types or simple, primitive types (e.g., `i32`, `f32`) that are compatible with the program context.

Example:
Original code:
```rust
struct Container<T> {
    value: T,
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Container::<i32> { value: 10 };
}
```

Mutated code:
```rust
struct Container<T> {
    value: T,
}

fn main() {
    let _ = Container::<i32, f32> { value: 10 };
}
```

This mutation operator introduces an extra generic argument, potentially causing the compiler to encounter an unexpected state due to the mismatch in the number of generic parameters, thus increasing the likelihood of triggering a bug as seen in the given bug report.
