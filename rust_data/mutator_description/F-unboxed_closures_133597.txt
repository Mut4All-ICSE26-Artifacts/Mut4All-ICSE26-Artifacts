Mutation Operator

Target: Trait Definition with Associated Type

Step-by-step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that defines a function returning an `impl Trait` type.
2. Modify the trait definition to include an associated type with a constraint that creates a cyclic dependency or is unsatisfiable.

Example:
Original Trait Definition:
```rust
pub trait MyTrait {
    fn my_function() -> impl Sized + FnOnce<()>;
}
```

Mutated Trait Definition:
```rust
pub trait MyTrait {
    type AssocType: Sized + FnOnce<()>;

    fn my_function() -> Self::AssocType;
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces an associated type `AssocType` constrained by the same requirements as the function's return type. This can create conflicts, especially if the trait is implemented for a type that cannot satisfy the associated type's bounds. The mutation exploits potential inconsistencies and edge cases in the Rust compiler's handling of associated types and `impl Trait` return types.
