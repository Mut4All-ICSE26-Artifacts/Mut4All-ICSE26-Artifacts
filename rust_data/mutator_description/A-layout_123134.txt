Mutation Operator: Unsized Field Placement in Struct

Target: Struct definitions in Rust code.

Mutation Rule: 

1. Identify a struct definition in the Rust code that has multiple fields.

2. Select a field within the struct that is currently defined as a `Sized` type. This field should not be the first field in the struct.

3. Change the type of this selected field to an unsized type, such as a slice (`[T]`), a trait object (`dyn Trait`), or a type implementing `?Sized`.

4. Ensure that at least one of the fields before the unsized field remains a `Sized` type. This is crucial because Rust requires any unsized field to be the last field in the struct unless it is behind a pointer.

Example:

Before Mutation:
```
struct Example {
    field1: u32,
    field2: u32,
    field3: [u8; 4],
}
```

After Mutation:
```
struct Example {
    field1: u32,
    field2: [u8],
    field3: [u8; 4],
}
```

The mutation introduces an unsized field (`field2: [u8]`) in a non-terminal position, which can trigger layout issues and potentially cause a compiler crash due to unsized field constraints not being met. The mutation exploits the Rust compiler's handling of struct field layout, especially when unsized types are involved.
