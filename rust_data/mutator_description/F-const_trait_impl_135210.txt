Mutation Operator:
Target Code Construct: Closure and Trait Bound in Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a closure within a function that involves type casting or dereferencing operations.
2. Within the closure, locate a type conversion or dereferencing expression that involves casting or converting one reference type to another. For example, `&*variable as &TargetType`.
3. Modify the type conversion to cast to an incompatible or non-const trait type. This can involve changing the target type in the cast to a type that does not satisfy the required trait bounds.
4. Ensure that the types involved in the mutation already exist in the seed program to maximize the chance of triggering a compiler bug.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
const _: fn(&String) = |s| {
    &*s as &str;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
const _: fn(&String) = |s| {
    &*s as &SomeOtherType; // Change the target type to a type that does not satisfy the const trait bound
};
```

Note:
- Ensure that `SomeOtherType` is a type that exists in the seed program but does not implement the required trait for the conversion. This increases the likelihood of triggering compiler bugs related to trait resolution and type checking.
- This mutation operator targets scenarios where type compatibility and trait implementation are crucial, making it effective in exploring compiler behavior around trait bounds and type conversions.
