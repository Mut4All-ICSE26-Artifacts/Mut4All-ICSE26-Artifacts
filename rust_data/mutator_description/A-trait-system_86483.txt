Mutation Operator: Modify Associated Type Without Default

Target Code Construct: Rust trait definitions with associated types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that has an associated type declared using the `type` keyword.
2. Ensure this associated type has a where clause that imposes constraints on it.
3. Remove any existing default implementation or constraints for this associated type to create a scenario where it lacks a default or required bounds.
4. Introduce a new associated type in the same or different trait without providing a default implementation or necessary bounds. Ensure the existing trait is modified to use this new associated type in a function or method.

Example:
Given a seed program with a trait definition like:

```rust
trait ExampleTrait<T> {
    type AssociatedType: Iterator<Item = T>;
}
```

Apply the mutation:

1. Remove any constraints or defaults from `AssociatedType` in the trait.
```rust
trait ExampleTrait<T> {
    type AssociatedType;
}
```

2. Introduce a new associated type `NewAssociatedType` in the same or another trait without providing a default or constraints, and use it in a function.
```rust
trait AnotherTrait<U> {
    type NewAssociatedType;
    fn another_function(&self) -> Self::NewAssociatedType;
}
```

This mutation operator targets the absence of defaults or constraints for associated types in traits, which can potentially expose issues with the Rust compiler's trait system, especially when dealing with generic associated types.
