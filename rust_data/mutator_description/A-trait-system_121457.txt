Mutation Operator: Modify Existing Lifetime Annotations

Target Code Construct: `impl` blocks with lifetime annotations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an `impl` block that makes use of lifetime annotations, such as `impl<'a, I: 'a + Iterable> Iterable for &'a I`.
2. Within this `impl` block, locate any associated type definitions that utilize lifetimes, such as `type Item<'a>: 'a;`.
3. Modify the lifetime annotations by introducing a new lifetime parameter and applying it in a way that conflicts with existing lifetimes:

   a. Introduce a new lifetime parameter at the start of the `impl` block. For instance, modify `impl<'a, I: 'a + Iterable> Iterable for &'a I` to `impl<'b, 'a, I: 'a + Iterable> Iterable for &'a I`.

   b. Change the associated type definition to use this new lifetime in a manner that creates a conflict. For example, replace `type Item<'a>: 'a;` with `type Item<'b>: 'a;`.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
impl<'a, I: 'a + Iterable> Iterable for &'a I {
    type Item<'a>: 'a;
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
impl<'b, 'a, I: 'a + Iterable> Iterable for &'a I {
    type Item<'b>: 'a;
}
```

This mutation introduces a lifetime conflict that can lead to unexpected behavior or trigger an ICE in the compiler due to the complex interaction of lifetimes in the `impl` block.
