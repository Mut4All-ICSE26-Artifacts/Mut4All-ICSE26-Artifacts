Mutation Operator: Async Closure to Async Block

Target Code Construct: Closure Expressions

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify async closures in the seed program. These are closures prefixed with the `async` keyword, for example, `let c = async move || {}`.

2. Convert the async closure into an async block by removing the closure syntax `||` and replacing it with an async block `{}`.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate all instances of `async` closures in the code.
- Remove the `||` part from the closure.
- Enclose the closure body within an `async {}` block.

Example:
Original Code: 
```
let my_async_closure = async || {
    // some async operations
};
```

Mutated Code: 
```
let my_async_block = async {
    // some async operations
};
```

This mutation operator focuses on transforming async closures, which are known to be unstable, into async blocks, which are stable and can trigger compiler issues related to the handling of async constructs. This approach leverages existing code structures and should be applicable to a wide range of Rust programs that use async features.
