Mutation Operator 1: Target Closure with Mutable References

- Target: Closure inside a function.

- Mutation Rule:
  1. Identify a closure within a function that captures a mutable reference to `self` or any other mutable variable.
  2. Modify the closure to attempt to borrow a mutable reference at a point where another immutable borrow is active.
  3. Specifically, introduce a new immutable borrow within the closure before the mutable borrow, ensuring that it spans across or conflicts with the mutable borrow.

- Example in pseudo-code form:

Original code:
```
fn example_function(&mut self) {
    let closure = |arg: ArgType| -> ResultType {
        self.some_mutable_method(arg);
        Ok(self.some_other_method())
    };
    // Further code
}
```

Mutated code:
```
fn example_function(&mut self) {
    let closure = |arg: ArgType| -> ResultType {
        let immutable_ref = &self.some_field; // New immutable borrow
        self.some_mutable_method(arg);        // Conflicting mutable borrow
        // Use immutable_ref in a way that its borrow interferes with mutable borrow
        Ok(self.some_other_method())
    };
    // Further code
}
```

- Explanation:
  By introducing an immutable borrow of a structure field before a mutable borrow within a closure, this mutation tests how the borrow checker handles conflicting borrows within the same closure scope, potentially exposing issues in borrow checking and lifetime analysis.
