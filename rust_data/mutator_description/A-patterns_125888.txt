Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Enum variant with lifetimes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate an enum definition with a variant that includes a pointer or reference type.
2. If the variant involves lifetimes (e.g., `*const &'a T`), ensure that the lifetime `'a` is not declared or used improperly.
3. Modify the pattern matching on the enum variant to introduce a type or lifetime mismatch:
   - Change the matched pattern to a different, incompatible type or enum variant.
   - For example, attempt to match against a non-existent variant or use an incorrect nested enum member.
4. Ensure the rest of the code uses variables and types already declared in the seed program, avoiding the introduction of undeclared or new structures without explicit declarations.
5. Example transformation:
   - Original: 
     ```rust
     enum MyEnum {
         Variant(*const &'a ()),
     }
     
     fn handle_enum(x: MyEnum) {
         match x {
             MyEnum::Variant(NestedEnum::First) => {}
         }
     }
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```rust
     enum MyEnum {
         Variant(*const &'a ()),
     }
     
     fn handle_enum(x: MyEnum) {
         match x {
             MyEnum::Variant(NestedEnum::NonExistent) => {} // Introduce a pattern that doesn't match
         }
     }
     ```
   
This mutation is intended to exploit pattern matching and lifetime mismanagement, which are known to be areas that can trigger internal compiler errors (ICE) or unexpected behavior in the Rust compiler.
