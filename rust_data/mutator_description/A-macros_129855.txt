Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Inside Async Closure

Target Code Construct: Macro usage within an async closure

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an async closure in the code, which is a closure prefixed by the `async` keyword, such as `async |param| { /* body */ }`.
2. Locate a macro call within the body of this async closure, for example, `println!()`.
3. Modify the macro call by introducing a macro expansion with additional placeholder values or patterns that do not match the expected format.
4. Specifically, introduce a macro pattern that does not have a corresponding entry or key, which could be achieved by adding an additional incorrect parameter or changing the existing pattern, such as:
   - From: `println!()`
   - To: `println!("{:?}", undefined_var)`
5. Ensure that the introduced modification utilizes an undefined variable or type that is not declared in the surrounding code to stimulate macro expansion errors.

Example Transformation:
Original Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    foo(async |who| println!());
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    foo(async |who| println!("{:?}", undefined_var));
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces an error by attempting to use a variable `undefined_var` that is not declared anywhere in the code. This can cause the macro expansion process to become inconsistent, potentially triggering internal compiler errors related to missing entries or unexpected values during macro resolution.
