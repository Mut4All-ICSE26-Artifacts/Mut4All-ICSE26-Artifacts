Mutation Operator: Modify Return Type with Undefined Type

Target: This mutation operator applies to function definitions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that has a defined return type.
2. Replace the defined return type with an undefined or placeholder type `_`, which is not allowed in item signature return types.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a function definition, such as `fn sample_function() -> i32`.
- Modify the return type, changing it from its current type (`i32`) to an undefined type (`_`).
- Ensure the function now looks like this: `fn sample_function() -> _`.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub fn calculate() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
pub fn calculate() -> _ {
    42
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation operator introduces a placeholder return type (`_`) which is not allowed within types on item signatures. This mutation targets the type-checking phase of the compiler and is prone to trigger errors where the expected type is ambiguous or undefined, potentially leading to an ICE or a similar compiler crash. This mutation thus leverages the compiler's strict type system to explore edge cases that may not be well-handled.
