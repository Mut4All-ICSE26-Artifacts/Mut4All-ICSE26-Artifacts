Mutation Operator: Missing Lifetime in Trait Implementation

Target Construct: Trait implementations in Rust code, specifically for async functions in traits where lifetime parameters are involved.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the Rust code that has functions requiring lifetime parameters. The trait should include at least one async function.
2. Implement the trait for a struct in another crate or module. Ensure that the implementation does not specify the lifetime parameter(s) where required.
3. Specifically, omit the lifetime parameter(s) in the implementation of the trait for the struct, even though they are specified in the trait definition.

Example of Mutation:
- Original Trait Definition (in crate `one`):
  ```rust
  pub trait DataAccess<'a> {
      fn load_data(&self, data: &'a [u8]);
      async fn process(&mut self);
  }
  ```

- Original Struct and Implementation (in crate `two`):
  ```rust
  struct Database;

  // Incorrect trait implementation by omitting the lifetime parameters
  impl DataAccess for Database {
      fn load_data(&self, data: &[u8]) {
          // Function implementation
      }

      async fn process(&mut self) {
          // Async function implementation
      }
  }
  ```

- Mutated Implementation:
  1. Start with the struct `Database` in a different crate from the trait definition.
  2. Implement the `DataAccess` trait for `Database` without specifying the expected lifetime parameter in the trait implementation line:
     ```rust
     // Mutated line causing potential ICE
     impl DataAccess for Database {
         // Same method bodies, but missing lifetime specification
     }
     ```

The mutation operator exploits a specific issue where omitting required lifetime parameters in trait implementations, especially across crates, can lead to internal compiler errors (ICE) related to lifetime elision and region inference. This mutation tests the Rust compiler's handling of lifetimes and async functions in traits, pushing the boundaries of its current inference and checking capabilities.
