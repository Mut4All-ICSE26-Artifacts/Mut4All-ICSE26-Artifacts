Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation Inheritance for Unsized Types

This mutation operator targets the implementation of traits for types, particularly focusing on manipulating const trait implementations and their inheritance for unsized types, which could potentially expose issues related to compiler behavior.

Steps:
1. Identify a const trait implementation in the seed program. For example, an impl block that implements a const trait for a specific type.

2. Modify the target type of the trait implementation to include an unsized type, such as a trait object or a slice type. For instance, if the original trait implementation was for a sized type like i32, change it to a trait object like dyn SomeTrait or a slice like [T].

3. Ensure that the unsized type respects the bounds and requirements of the trait. If the unsized type is a trait object, it should implement the necessary trait. If it is a slice, ensure it's within the context of a generic type parameter that meets the required trait bounds.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
#[const_trait]
trait Bar {}

impl const Bar for i32 {}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
#[const_trait]
trait Bar {}

impl<T: ?Sized + Bar> const Bar for T {}
```

Explanation:
- The original implementation is for a sized type (i32). The mutation changes this to support unsized types by using a generic parameter with a ?Sized bound, which allows types like slices or trait objects.
- This modification may expose issues with the Rust compilerâ€™s handling of trait implementations for unsized types, particularly in const contexts, thereby increasing the likelihood of uncovering coherence or inference bugs.
