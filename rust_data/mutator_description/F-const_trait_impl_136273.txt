Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds in Trait Implementations

Target Code Construct: Trait implementation for structs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify trait implementations in the code, particularly those marked with `const`.
2. For each implementation block, introduce an additional trait bound on the type parameter that is unlikely to be satisfied universally.
3. In the trait implementation header, append a trait bound such as `T: Deref`, where `Deref` is not already a constraint for `T` in the context.

Example of Mutation:
Original Trait Implementation:
```rust
impl<T> const Deref for Wrap<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

Mutated Trait Implementation:
```rust
impl<T: Deref> const Deref for Wrap<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &T {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

Explanation of Mutation:
This mutation adds a constraint `T: Deref` to the implementation of `const Deref`. If `T` does not inherently satisfy this trait bound, it may lead to trait bound errors or even an ICE if the compiler's handling of `const_trait_impl` is flawed. This mutation specifically targets the trait bounds in trait implementation headers and leverages constraints that are not guaranteed to be satisfied by all types `T`.
