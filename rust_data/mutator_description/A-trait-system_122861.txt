Mutation Operator

Target Construct: Trait Implementation for a Struct or Enum

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing trait implementation block for a struct or enum in the seed program. For instance, an implementation might look like `impl SomeTrait for SomeStruct {}`.
2. Introduce a lifetime parameter to the trait implementation that is not used or declared elsewhere in the code. This lifetime should be distinct from any existing lifetimes in the struct or trait.
3. Insert or modify the lifetime in a way that it is syntactically correct but semantically incorrect, leading to the potential for an internal compiler error or lifetime-related error.

Instructions:
- Locate the trait implementation. For example:
  ```rust
  impl<S: SomeTrait> Display for MyStruct<S> {}
  ```
- Introduce a new lifetime parameter in the trait implementation's header. For example, add `'unused`:
  ```rust
  impl<'unused, S: SomeTrait> Display for MyStruct<S> {}
  ```
- Ensure `'unused` is not used or referenced in the trait or struct, similar to:
  ```rust
  impl<'unused> SomeTrait for MyStruct {}
  ```
- Do not make any changes to the struct or trait methodologies to accommodate this lifetime, so that it remains deliberately unused.

Example:
- Original trait implementation:
  ```rust
  impl<B: ?Sized> Display for Cow<'a, B> {}
  ```
- Mutated trait implementation:
  ```rust
  impl<'unused, B: ?Sized> Display for Cow<'a, B> {}
  ```

This mutation is targeted to trigger errors related to unused or undeclared lifetimes, which are common issues leading to internal compiler errors, as seen in the provided bug report. This operator exploits the Rust compiler's trait system, particularly its handling of lifetimes in trait implementations.
