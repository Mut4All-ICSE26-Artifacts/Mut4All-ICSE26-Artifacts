Mutation Operator: Inner to Outer Attribute Conversion

Target Code Construct: Attribute in a procedural macro context.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify inner attributes within a procedural macro output, indicated by `#![...]`.
2. Convert the inner attribute to an outer attribute by removing the `#!` and retaining the `#[...]` structure.

Example of Mutation:
Given Seed Program Code:
```
let output = quote::quote! {
    #![deny(missing_docs)]
    #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub struct ICE();
};
```

Post-Mutation Code:
```
let output = quote::quote! {
    #[deny(missing_docs)]
    #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
    #[allow(missing_docs)]
    pub struct ICE();
};
```

Explanation:
- Locate the `#![deny(missing_docs)]` inner attribute.
- Convert it to `#[deny(missing_docs)]` to make it an outer attribute.
- This mutation is meant to exploit the potential mishandling of attribute context by the Rust compiler, especially within procedural macros, leading to ICEs or unexpected behavior.
