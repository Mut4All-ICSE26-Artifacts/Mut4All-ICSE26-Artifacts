Mutation Operator: Introduce PhantomData Misuse in Struct

Target: Struct Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the seed program that does not currently utilize `PhantomData`.
2. Modify the struct to include a `PhantomData` field with a generic type parameter that is not declared in the struct.
3. Ensure the `PhantomData` field is used in the struct initialization, where the generic type is not specified or mismatched.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Sample {
    x: i32,
    y: f64,
}
```

Mutation:
```
struct Sample {
    x: i32,
    y: f64,
    phantom: PhantomData<U>, // Introduced PhantomData with undeclared type U
}

// During initialization
let instance = Sample { x: 10, y: 20.0, phantom: PhantomData };
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces a `PhantomData` field using a generic type parameter `U` that is not declared or defined anywhere in the struct or its surrounding context. This kind of mutation can lead to mismatches in expected types, particularly when interacting with type-aliases and `impl` traits, increasing the likelihood of triggering a compiler ICE (Internal Compiler Error). The `PhantomData` misuse can exploit the compiler's type-checking logic, especially when dealing with type inference and exhaustiveness-checking related to `impl` traits.
