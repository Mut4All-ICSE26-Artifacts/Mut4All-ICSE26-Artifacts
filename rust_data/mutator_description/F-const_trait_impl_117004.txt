Mutation Operator: Modify Const Trait Method in a Non-Const Context

Target Code Construct: Function Implementation with Const Traits

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function implementation where a method of a const trait is invoked. This function should not be marked as const, but it should operate in a context where const-ness is required or implied.
2. Within this function, replace the const trait method call with a call to a non-const or regular method. If such a method doesn't exist, introduce a new non-const method in the trait with the same signature.
3. Ensure that the non-const method provides the same functionality but does not have the const qualifier, causing the context to mismatch with the const trait requirements.
4. Apply this change uniformly across all relevant function calls to highlight the mismatch between const and non-const contexts.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl<T: ~const Stone> Wall<T> {
    fn new(value: T) -> Self {
        Self(value.get_record())
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl<T: ~const Stone> Wall<T> {
    fn new(value: T) -> Self {
        Self(value.get_record_non_const())
    }
}

// Add a non-const method to the trait
impl Stone for Brick {
    type Recorded = i32;
    
    fn get_record(&self) -> i32 {
        0
    }
    
    fn get_record_non_const(&self) -> i32 {
        0
    }
}
```

This mutation is designed to test how the Rust compiler handles discrepancies between const and non-const method implementations within contexts requiring const correctness, potentially exposing inconsistencies or bugs in the const trait handling logic.
