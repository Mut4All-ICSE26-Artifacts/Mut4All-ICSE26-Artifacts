Mutation Operator: Replace Return Type with impl Trait

Target Function and method definitions with explicit return types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify: Locate all non-main top-level functions and methods in inherent impl blocks that have a concrete return type (-> T).
2. Construct a new return type using impl Trait syntax with the trait bounds:for<'a> Sized: where the trait is bounded over a generic lifetime 'a and Clone: to add a behavioral constraint.
3. Replace the original return type T with:-> impl for<'a> Sized + Clone.
4. Ensure uniqueness of the generated lifetime 'a by checking against all already-used lifetimes, to avoid conflicts.

Example:
Original Code
```rust
fn compute() -> MyStruct {
    MyStruct {}
}
```

Mutated Code
```rust
fn compute() -> impl for<'a> Sized + Clone {
    MyStruct {}
}
```

Explanation of Mutation:
This mutation operator transforms return types into opaque impl Trait constructs that include a lifetime-bound Sized trait (for<'a>  Sized) and a regular trait (Clone). The introduction of for<'a> bound explores high-rank trait bounds (HRTB) interactions with return types, and the composition with Clone checks trait object compatibility and layout correctness.
