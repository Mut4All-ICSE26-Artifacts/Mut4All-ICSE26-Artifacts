Mutation Operator: Recursive Function Call with Modified Arguments

Target Code Construct:
This mutation targets functions, especially those defined as the entry point like `main`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition within the seed program. For this mutation, typically choose the entry function, such as `main`.
2. Within the function body, locate a recursive call to the same function. If none exists, introduce one by adding a call to the function itself with appropriate arguments.
3. Modify the arguments of this function call to use an existing array or vector, and ensure to incorporate indexing that may not be properly defined or guarded.
4. If an array is already being used, ensure to use an index that is either undefined or potentially out-of-bounds.
5. Ensure that any types and variables referenced are pre-declared in the seed program. Avoid introducing undeclared or new types and variables.

Example in Pseudo-code:
- Original:
  ```
  fn example() {
      // function body
  }
  ```

- Mutated:
  ```
  fn example() {
      let arr = vec![1, 2, 3];
      example(arr[i]);
  }
  ```

Explanation:
In this mutation, the recursive call `example(arr[i])` is introduced. `arr` is an existing vector and `i` should be an index variable that is either undeclared within the function's scope or could potentially take a value out-of-bounds. This mimics the pattern seen in the bug report that triggers assertion failures in the Rust compiler when dealing with unexpected indexing in recursive calls. This mutation ensures a broad coverage by exploiting indexing and recursive call patterns, which are prone to misuse and can reveal underlying issues in compiler handling of bounds and recursion.
