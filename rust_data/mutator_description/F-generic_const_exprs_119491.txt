Mutation Operator: Function Return Type Variation

Target: Function return types in function signatures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a return type involving `impl Trait`.
2. Change the `impl Trait` return type to a different trait that is not directly compatible with the function's intended return type.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn compute_values() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    vec![1, 2, 3].into_iter()
}
```

Mutation:
1. Locate the return type `-> impl Iterator<Item = i32>`.
2. Change it to `-> impl Future<Output = i32>`.

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn compute_values() -> impl Future<Output = i32> {
    vec![1, 2, 3].into_iter()
}
```

Notes:
- Ensure the new trait (`Future` in this example) has a different characteristic from the original trait (`Iterator`).
- This mutation can cause the compiler to struggle with incorrect trait bounds or mismatched types, potentially exposing bugs.
- In cases where the function body is incompatible with the new trait, the mutation might require adding a suitable async or await construct to maintain syntactical correctness, though itâ€™s more effective to rely on existing code constructs for immediate compilation issues.
