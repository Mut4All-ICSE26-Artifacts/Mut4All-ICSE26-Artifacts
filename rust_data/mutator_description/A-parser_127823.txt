Mutation Operator: Modify Constant Declaration with Unicode Character

Target: Constant Declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constant declaration in the seed program, which follows the structure `const <NAME>: <TYPE> = <VALUE>;`.
2. Select a valid operator or symbol in the constant declaration line. This can be an assignment operator (`=`) or a mathematical operator (such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Replace the selected operator with a visually similar Unicode character that is not a valid operator in Rust. For instance, replace `=` with `⩵` (Unicode character '⩵', Two Consecutive Equals Signs).
4. Ensure that the rest of the syntax remains unchanged to maintain the overall structure of the code.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```rust
const A: u32 = 10;
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
const A: u32 ⩵ 10;
```

This mutation introduces a Unicode character that resembles a valid operator but is not recognized by the Rust compiler, potentially triggering parsing errors or internal compiler errors (ICEs).
