Mutation Operator

Target: Struct Definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with generic parameters and at least one field.
2. Modify the type of one of the fields to use an existing generic parameter wrapped within a tuple. For example, change a field type from `T` to `(T, T)`.
3. Ensure that the overall structure remains syntactically correct by adjusting any associated implementations or initializations as necessary. Adjust any function or method signatures that might interact with the modified field to maintain consistency.

Example:

Given the struct:
```
struct Container<T> {
    value: T,
}
```

Mutation:
```
struct Container<T> {
    value: (T, T),
}
```

Example Adjustments:
- If `Container` is being instantiated or used in a function, ensure that the new tuple form `(value, value)` is provided where `T` was originally expected.
- Ensure all related methods or functions that manipulate `value` are adjusted to handle the tuple form `(T, T)`.

This mutation aims to test how the compiler handles the increased complexity in struct field types, specifically focusing on layout and size implications in constant evaluation.
