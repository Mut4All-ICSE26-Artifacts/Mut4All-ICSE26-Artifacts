Mutation Operator

Target Code Construct: Struct Implementation Block

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the implementation block of a struct where an associated type is defined.
2. Introduce a conditional compilation feature gate that guards the usage of an associated type.
3. Add a conditional compilation block (`#[cfg(feature = "special_case")]`) around the definition of the associated type. This will simulate the scenario where the presence of the associated type depends on a specific feature being enabled, which might not always be the case during compilation, potentially triggering edge cases.
4. Ensure the rest of the code is adjusted to selectively use this associated type based on the feature flag.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
struct Sample<T>(T);

impl<T> Sample<T> {
    type Result = T;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct Sample<T>(T);

impl<T> Sample<T> {
    #[cfg(feature = "special_case")]
    type Result = T;
}
```

Note: This mutation operator assumes the existence of a conditional compilation feature "special_case" in the seed program. If the feature does not exist, it should be declared at the beginning of the program using `#![cfg(feature = "special_case")]`, and appropriate feature setup in `Cargo.toml` should be considered.
