Mutation Operator: Alter Function Signature

Target: Trait method declaration

1. Identify a trait with one or more method declarations. For this mutation, locate a method that takes a lifetime parameter or an associated type with a lifetime.
   
2. Modify the signature of the trait method by adding or changing the lifetime parameter to one that conflicts with the existing lifetimes or introduces ambiguity. For example, if the method signature is:
   `extern "C" fn read_dword(Self::Assoc<'_>) -> u16;`
   Change it to:
   `extern "C" fn read_dword(&'_ Self::Assoc<'_>) -> u16;`

3. Ensure that the method implementation in the struct adheres to the new signature. If the original implementation is:
   `extern "C" fn read_dword(&'_ self) -> u16 { ... }`
   Modify it to:
   `extern "C" fn read_dword(&'_ self::Assoc<'_>) -> u16 { ... }`

4. The key mutation here is to introduce a self-referential lifetime or incoherent lifetime usage, which can lead to borrow checker errors or ICEs in the compiler.

5. The mutation should maintain valid syntax but introduce logical errors in type or lifetime relationships that challenge the borrow checker's assumptions. 

This mutation taps into the borrow checker's handling of lifetimes and associated types, areas prone to subtle and complex bugs, increasing the chance of revealing inconsistencies or issues in lifetime resolution during compilation.
