Mutation Operator: Recursive Function Return Type Mutation

Target: Functions with a recursive call in their body where the return type is specified using `impl Trait`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function within the program that includes a recursive call to itself and uses the `impl Trait` syntax for its return type.
2. Modify the return type of this function to be a concrete type or different trait that is part of the existing traits implemented within the program. Ensure this modification does not maintain the `impl Trait` syntax.
3. If no suitable existing trait or type is available, introduce a new trait with minimal requirements and implement it for a type that fits the context of the function.

Example:
Original Code:
```
fn recursive_function() -> impl TraitA {
    recursive_function()
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
trait NewTrait {}
impl NewTrait for u32 {}

fn recursive_function() -> NewTrait {
    recursive_function()
}
```

Explanation:
In the example, the function `recursive_function` originally returns `impl TraitA`, which triggers an ICE due to the infinity recursive call and the use of `impl Trait`. The mutation changes the return type to a concrete implementation `NewTrait`, which is implemented by `u32` in this context. This mutation operator forces the compiler to handle concrete types and implementations, potentially exposing different bugs related to type resolution and trait implementations.
