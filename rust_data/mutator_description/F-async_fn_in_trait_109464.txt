Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method Signature with Lifetime Annotations

Targeted Construct: Trait method definitions, specifically `async` functions in traits.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait method definition that includes an `async` function. For example, within a trait similar to the `State` trait in the given code.
2. Introduce lifetime annotations to the method signature. If lifetimes are already present, modify them or introduce additional lifetimes.
3. Ensure that the lifetimes are applied consistently to both parameters and return types where applicable.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the `async fn` within a trait. For instance, in the `State` trait, the `async fn execute`.
- Introduce a lifetime parameter `'a` to the trait definition, if not already present.
- Modify the method signature to include the lifetime annotation. For instance, change `async fn execute(self, shared_state: &SharedState);` to `async fn execute<'a>(self, shared_state: &'a SharedState);`.
- Ensure that the implementation of the trait method in any struct also reflects these lifetime changes.

Example of Mutation:
Original:
```rust
pub trait State {
    async fn execute(self, shared_state: &SharedState);
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
pub trait State {
    async fn execute<'a>(self, shared_state: &'a SharedState);
}
```

This mutation operator targets the interaction between async functions and lifetime management, a known area that can expose potential weaknesses in the Rust compiler's handling of async trait methods.
