Mutation Operator

Target: Generic Type Definitions in Traits
This mutation operator targets the trait definitions that utilize generic associated types (GATs).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that defines a generic type using GATs. For instance, `trait Base` with a type declaration like `type Base<B>;`.
2. Modify the trait to introduce a new associated type with an additional parameter. This additional parameter should be of a different type to the existing one.
3. Ensure the new associated type is used in an existing function within the trait, replacing the original type.

Steps:
a. Locate the trait `Base` with the associated type `type Base<B>;`.
b. Change the associated type to `type Base<B, Extra>;` where `Extra` is a new generic type parameter.
c. Modify a function within the trait (such as `fmap`) to use the new associated type signature. For example, change `fn fmap<B>(self, f: impl Fn(A) -> B) -> Self::Base<B>;` to `fn fmap<B, Extra>(self, f: impl Fn(A) -> B) -> Self::Base<B, Extra>;`.
d. Update any constraints or where clauses to utilize the newly introduced generic type parameter `Extra`.

Example (pseudo-code):
Original Code:
```rust
trait Base {
    type Base<B>;
    fn fmap<B>(self, f: impl Fn(A) -> B) -> Self::Base<B>;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait Base {
    type Base<B, Extra>;
    fn fmap<B, Extra>(self, f: impl Fn(A) -> B) -> Self::Base<B, Extra>;
}
```

This mutation can expose inconsistencies in handling additional generic parameters in GATs, potentially triggering compiler issues related to generic type resolution or instantiation.
