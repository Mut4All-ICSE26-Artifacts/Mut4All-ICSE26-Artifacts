Mutation Operator: Modify Const Parameters in Type Constraints

Target Code Construct: Function definition with generic type parameters and const expressions, specifically in the `where` clause.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the Rust code that has generic type parameters and const parameters in the `where` clause. For instance, a function using `Dst: BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<Src, { const_exprs }>`.
2. For each const parameter used within the `where` clause, change the type of the constant from its current type to another integer type or replace it with a boolean expression. For example, if the const parameter is an integer like `{0u8}`, change it to an expression such as `{0u32}` or `{false}`.
3. Ensure that these changes are made uniformly across all usages within the scope of the function to maintain consistency in potential type mismatches.

Example of Mutation:
Original:
```rust
pub fn is_transmutable<
    Src,
    Dst,
    const ASSUME_ALIGNMENT: bool,
    const ASSUME_LIFETIMES: bool,
    const ASSUME_SAFETY: bool,
    const ASSUME_VALIDITY: bool,
>()
where
    Dst: BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<
        Src,
        { 0u8 }
    >,
{}
```

Mutated:
```rust
pub fn is_transmutable<
    Src,
    Dst,
    const ASSUME_ALIGNMENT: bool,
    const ASSUME_LIFETIMES: bool,
    const ASSUME_SAFETY: bool,
    const ASSUME_VALIDITY: bool,
>()
where
    Dst: BikeshedIntrinsicFrom<
        Src,
        { false }
    >,
{}
```

Details:
- This operator targets functions that use generic constants in type constraints, specifically focusing on the `where` clause.
- The mutation aims to trigger compiler behavior by swapping integer const expressions with boolean expressions. This can reveal inconsistencies or incorrect handling of generic const expressions within the Rust compiler's type system.
- The operator checks for potential transmutability issues by altering the assumed const parameters, such as safety, alignment, and validity, which are critical to memory operations.
