Mutation Operator: Attribute Macro Invocation with Undefined Macro

Target Code Construct: Attribute Macros applied to items (e.g., structs, enums, functions).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a code item (struct, enum, function, etc.) that has an existing attribute macro applied to it.
2. Replace the attribute macro's current invocation or add a new attribute macro with a macro invocation that is defined using `macro_rules!` but does not define any macro body or behavior. 
3. Ensure the macro invocation uses parentheses or curly braces as per typical macro syntax.
4. Ensure the macro name is valid but make sure it doesn't resolve or expand to a valid value/type.

Example before mutation:
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct ExampleStruct {
    field: i32,
}
```

Example after mutation:
```rust
macro_rules! undefined_macro {}
#[derive(undefined_macro!())]
struct ExampleStruct {
    field: i32,
}
```

In this mutation, we have introduced an attribute macro `undefined_macro!()` with an undefined behavior, which is likely to trigger parsing errors or ICE (Internal Compiler Errors) due to the unresolved macro invocation in the attribute position.
