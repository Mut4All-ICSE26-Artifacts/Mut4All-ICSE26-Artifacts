Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method Signature

Target: Trait methods with const generic parameters.

Step-by-step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that has a method with const generic parameters. For example, trait MyTrait { fn my_function<const N: usize>(&self) -> usize; }.

2. Alter the default type of the const generic parameter within the method signature to a different, incompatible type. For instance, change const N: usize = 10 to const N: usize = "string_value". This will cause a conflict as usize expects an integer value, not a string.

3. Ensure that the method body is adjusted or left as is, to intentionally cause inconsistency. For example, fn my_function<const N: usize = "string_value">(&self) -> usize { 0 }.

Justification:
This mutation targets the handling of const generics within trait methods, a known complex area, especially when it involves default parameter values. The mutation is likely to trigger rustc internal errors related to type handling and generic constraints, as the compiler may not be fully equipped to handle such conflicts gracefully. This operator has high coverage as it involves fundamental operations on generic parameters frequently used in traits, a common abstraction tool in Rust.
