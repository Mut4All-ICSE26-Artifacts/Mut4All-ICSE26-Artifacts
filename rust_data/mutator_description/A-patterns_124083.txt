Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Variant Pattern Matching

Target Construct: The mutation targets enum pattern matching in `if let` or `match` statements.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum pattern match within an `if let` or `match` statement. In this case, find the pattern `if let En1::Outest("foo")`.
2. Modify the pattern to insert a type mismatch. This can be achieved by changing the literal used in the pattern to a different type. In this example, `En1::Outest(42)` is used instead of `En1::Outest("foo")`, introducing a mismatch between the pattern and the expected type of the enum variant.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the `if let` or `match` statement in the code that involves an enum pattern match.
- Change the literal in the pattern to another type. For instance, replace a string literal with an integer literal, or vice versa.
- Ensure the modified literal's type mismatches the expected type of the enum variant's field.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
enum En1<T> {
    Outest(&'a T),
}

fn wrap_en1_1<T>(x: T) -> En1<T> {}

fn main() {
    if let En1::Outest("foo") = wrap_en1_1::<_>("foo") {}
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
enum En1<T> {
    Outest(&'a T),
}

fn wrap_en1_1<T>(x: T) -> En1<T> {}

fn main() {
    if let En1::Outest(42) = wrap_en1_1::<_>("foo") {}
}
```

Note: The mutation deliberately introduces a type mismatch in the pattern to exploit potential bugs in the compiler's pattern matching logic.
