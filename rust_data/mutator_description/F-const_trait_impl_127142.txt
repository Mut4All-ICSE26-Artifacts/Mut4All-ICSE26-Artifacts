Mutation Operator

Target: Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the code. For example, locate an impl block such as `impl const Foo for i32 {}`.
2. Modify the implementation to add a redundant generic type that overlaps with a specific type already specified. For instance, if there is an implementation for a specific type like `i32`, create a conflicting generic implementation for the same type.
3. Example:
   - Original: `impl const Foo for i32 {}`
   - Mutated: `impl<T> const Foo for i32 {}`

Explanation: 
By introducing a conflicting implementation using generics for a type that already has a specific implementation, you can trigger edge cases in specialization and trait resolution. This mutation tests how the compiler handles conflicts between specific and generic implementations, especially with the `const_trait_impl` and `min_specialization` features, which may expose vulnerabilities or inconsistencies in these mechanisms.
