Mutation Operator:

1. Target Code Construct:
   - The mutation targets functions using inline assembly with constant expressions, specifically those with asynchronous and unsafe code blocks.

2. Mutation Rule:
   - Locate an async unsafe function in the seed program that uses inline assembly with a const operand.
   - Within this function, introduce a const parameter in the function signature.
   - In the inline assembly statement, replace the existing non-declared const operand with the newly declared const parameter.

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:
   a. Identify an async unsafe function utilizing inline assembly with a `const` modifier.
   b. Modify the function signature to introduce a new const parameter:
      - Example: If the function signature is `async unsafe fn example()`, change it to `async unsafe fn example<const M: usize>()`.
   c. Replace the unidentified `const` operand within the asm! macro with the new const parameter:
      - Example: Change `asm!("/* {0} */", const N);` to `asm!("/* {0} */", const M);`.

4. Example:
   Original Code:
   ```rust
   async unsafe fn sample() {
       asm!("mov {0}, eax", const X);
   }
   ```

   Mutated Code:
   ```rust
   async unsafe fn sample<const M: usize>() {
       asm!("mov {0}, eax", const M);
   }
   ```

This mutation operator is designed to trigger potential issues with constant parameters in async and unsafe contexts, which are more likely to induce edge cases in the Rust compiler handling of inline assembly and MIR generation.
