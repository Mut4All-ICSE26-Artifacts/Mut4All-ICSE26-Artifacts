Mutation Operator

Target: Struct Definitions with Unsized Types

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a struct definition that incorporates fields of unsized types, such as `str` or `[T]` (slice types), which could trigger issues when calculating size or alignment.

2. Replace the unsized type field with a sized equivalent to ensure the struct is fully sized:
   - Change `str` field to a fixed-size array of `u8`, e.g., `[u8; N]`, where `N` is a predetermined length that reflects expected usage.
   - For slice types `[T]`, replace them with a fixed-size array `[T; N]`.

3. Ensure that the replacement maintains the representational intent of the original struct, so other logic depending on the struct remains valid.

Example:

Original Struct:
```rust
pub struct Example {
    pub id: u32,
    pub name: str,
    pub data: [i32],
}
```

Mutated Struct:
```rust
pub struct Example {
    pub id: u32,
    pub name: [u8; 32], // Assume a maximum length of 32 characters
    pub data: [i32; 10], // Assume a fixed length of 10
}
```

This operator aids in identifying issues when unsized types are incorrectly assumed to have a fixed size, leading to compiler crashes related to memory layout evaluations.
