Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method Signature

Target Construct: Trait method within a Rust trait.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program. This trait should have at least one method with generic parameters.
2. Select one of the methods with generic parameters, preferably one that is declared as `async fn`.
3. Modify the signature of this method by adding an additional generic parameter, ensuring that this new parameter is not constrained by any existing structures or bounds within the trait. Use an existing type from the seed program where possible, or introduce a generic type like `T` if no suitable type is available. Ensure the parameter is used in a context that makes logical sense, such as in the return type or where clauses if applicable.
4. Update the implementations of the trait by adding the same generic parameter to the corresponding method signatures. Ensure any uses of the method within these implementations are adjusted to accommodate the added parameter.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    async fn process<A, B>(&self);
}

impl ExampleTrait for MyStruct {
    async fn process<A, B>(&self) {}
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    async fn process<A, B, T>(&self);
}

impl ExampleTrait for MyStruct {
    async fn process<A, B, T>(&self) {}
}
```

In this example, a new generic parameter `T` is added to the `process` method in both the trait definition and its implementation.
