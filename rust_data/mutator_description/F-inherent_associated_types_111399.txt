Mutation Operator: Introduce Ambiguous Inherent Associated Type

Target: Implementation Blocks (impl) for Structs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct in the seed program that has an existing `impl` block. If no such struct exists, declare a simple struct and create an `impl` block for it.
2. Within the `impl` block, define a type alias with the `pub type` syntax.
3. Then, define a constant within the same `impl` block. This constant should use the type alias as its type.
4. To introduce ambiguity, declare another `impl` block for the same struct and define a new type alias with a different name but the same type as the first type alias, and use similar naming to the constants from the first `impl` block. This simulates a situation where inherent associated types might conflict or become ambiguous.

Example:
```
struct ExampleStruct;

impl ExampleStruct {
    pub type TypeA = usize;
    pub const VALUE: Self::TypeA = 42;
}

impl ExampleStruct {
    pub type TypeB = usize;
    pub const NEW_VALUE: Self::TypeB = 100;
}
```

This mutation introduces a scenario where both `impl` blocks define associated types that could potentially lead to ambiguity, especially when further referenced or extended. This could stress test the compiler's ability to handle inherent associated types across multiple implementation blocks.
