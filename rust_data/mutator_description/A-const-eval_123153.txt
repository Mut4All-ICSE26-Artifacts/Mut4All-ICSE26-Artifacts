Mutation Operator: Modify Static Mutable References

Target: Static mutable variables in structs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a static mutable variable in a struct declaration. In our example, `wl_callback_interface` is a static mutable variable.
2. Replace the static mutable variable with a constant or immutable static variable. This involves changing `mut` to immutable and ensuring that the initialization expression is compatible with immutability.
3. Update any references to this variable within other data structures or functions to ensure immutability is respected.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub static mut wl_callback_interface: wl_interface = wl_interface { version: 0 };
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
pub static wl_callback_interface: wl_interface = wl_interface { version: 0 };
```

Explanation:
- The mutation operator targets static mutable variables, which are often involved in complex interactions and can lead to subtle bugs when improperly handled.
- By converting a mutable static to an immutable static, the operator forces the code to respect immutability constraints, potentially exposing bugs related to unintended modifications or assumptions about mutability.
- This mutation operator is broadly applicable to Rust programs that use static mutable variables, ensuring high coverage across different codebases.
