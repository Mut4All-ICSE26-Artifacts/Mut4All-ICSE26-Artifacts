Mutation Operator: Alter Array Size in Generic Constants

Target: This mutation operator specifically targets generic constants in array types within function signatures or implementations, focusing on arrays involved in mathematical or logical operations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions or trait implementations that use arrays with generic constants in their signatures or bodies. Look for expressions like `[T; N]` or `[(&'a T, &'a U); N * N]`.
2. Modify the array type in the function signature or body by changing its size expression. This can be done by either:
   a. Doubling the size by replacing `N` with `N * 2`. For example, change `[T; N]` to `[T; N * 2]`.
   b. By adding a fixed size increment, such as replacing `N` with `N + 1`. For example, change `[U; N]` to `[U; N + 1]`.
3. Ensure that the array modification does not directly alter any array index calculation logic unless the logic is also updated to account for the new size.
4. Test the modified program to check if this change causes the compiler to crash or produces unexpected behavior.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
impl<'a, T, U, const N: usize> CrossProduct<'a, [U; N], [(&'a T, &'a U); N * N]> for [T; N] {
    fn cross(&'a self, us: &'a [U; N]) -> [(&'a T, &'a U); N * N] {
        std::array::from_fn(|i| (&self[i / N], &us[i % N]))
    }
}
```
Mutated:
```
impl<'a, T, U, const N: usize> CrossProduct<'a, [U; N * 2], [(&'a T, &'a U); (N * 2) * (N * 2)]> for [T; N * 2] {
    fn cross(&'a self, us: &'a [U; N * 2]) -> [(&'a T, &'a U); (N * 2) * (N * 2)] {
        std::array::from_fn(|i| (&self[i / (N * 2)], &us[i % (N * 2)]))
    }
}
```
In this example, the array sizes are doubled, demonstrating how the mutation introduces a potential for triggering unexpected behavior or compiler errors due to changes in size assumptions.
