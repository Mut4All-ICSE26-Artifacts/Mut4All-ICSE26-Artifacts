Mutation Operator: Modify Lifetime Annotations

Target Code Construct: Structs and Implementations

Description:
This mutation operator targets structs and their corresponding implementations by altering the lifetime annotations. Specifically, it introduces and modifies lifetime parameters in such a way that they become inconsistent or invalid, potentially uncovering compiler bugs related to lifetime handling.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition with a lifetime parameter, such as `struct StructName<'a>`.
2. Introduce a mismatch or invalid lifetime: 
   - Replace the existing correct lifetime with the reserved lifetime `'static`, which is known to cause issues as it is a reserved name.
   - Alternatively, introduce a new undeclared lifetime, like `'b`, that is not defined anywhere in the struct or its implementation.
3. Apply this mismatch in related implementations, ensuring the struct's implementation does not correctly use the declared lifetimes.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct Container<'a> {
    item: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> Container<'a> {
    fn new(item: &'a i32) -> Container<'a> {
        Container { item }
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct Container<'static> {
    item: &'b i32,
}

impl<'b> Container<'b> {
    fn new(item: &'b i32) -> Container<'b> {
        Container { item }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, the struct `Container` was originally using the lifetime `'a`. We applied two changes: 
- Changed `'a` to `'static` in the struct definition, which is invalid as `'static` is a reserved keyword.
- Replaced `'a` with undeclared `'b` as a lifetime in the struct field and implementation to introduce an inconsistency.
These changes can potentially lead to issues in the Rust compiler's lifetime resolution and checking mechanisms, increasing the likelihood of triggering related bugs.
