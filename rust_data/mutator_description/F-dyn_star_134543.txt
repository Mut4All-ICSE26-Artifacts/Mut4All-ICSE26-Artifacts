Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Definitions with Trait Bound Parameters

Mutation Rule: Modify functions with parameters that have trait bounds to include `dyn*` pointers. This operator targets functions that use trait bounds such as `T: Trait + ?Sized`, which are likely to be affected by the use of the `dyn*` feature.

Steps:
1. Identify functions with parameters that have trait bounds, especially those marked with `?Sized`.
2. For such a parameter `T`, introduce a new local variable within the function body of type `dyn* Trait` where `Trait` matches the trait bound in the function signature.
3. Attempt to assign the parameter `T` to this new `dyn* Trait` variable.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
fn process_item<T: SomeTrait + ?Sized>(item: T) {
    // original function logic
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn process_item<T: SomeTrait + ?Sized>(item: T) {
    let _: dyn* SomeTrait = item; // Mutation: Introduce `dyn*` pointer
    // rest of the function logic
}
```

This mutation leverages the use of `dyn*` pointers where the original function did not, increasing the likelihood of interacting with the bug related to the `dyn_star` feature. This approach ensures the mutation is broadly applicable to functions with trait-bounded parameters, enhancing the coverage of potential compiler bugs.
