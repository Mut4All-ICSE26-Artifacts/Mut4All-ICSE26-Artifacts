Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Parameters

Target: Struct definitions using const generic parameters.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with a const generic parameter that is of a type other than integers, `bool`, or `char`. For example, the original struct might be defined as:
   ```rust
   struct Example<const F: fn(usize) -> bool>;
   ```
2. Change the type of the const generic parameter to one of the supported types: integers, `bool`, or `char`. 
3. Ensure any associated instantiations or usages of the struct are updated to reflect this change. 
4. For instance, you may modify it to use an integer constant:
   ```rust
   struct Example<const F: usize>;
   ```

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct Validator<const F: fn(i32) -> bool>;

fn is_positive(val: i32) -> bool {
    val > 0
}

const _: Validator<is_positive> = Validator::<is_positive>;
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct Validator<const F: usize>;

const _: Validator<1> = Validator::<1>;
```

This change enforces compliance with the constraints on const generics, and by changing types, we may expose potential issues in how the Rust compiler handles these constructs, potentially leading to crashes if the compiler's const evaluation path is not correctly implemented or robust for all supported types.
