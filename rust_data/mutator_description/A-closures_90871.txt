Based on the bug report, the issue seems to be triggered by a closure expression used in an unexpected context, likely in a type position, which Rust's type checker isn't expecting. This indicates that the Rust compiler might have difficulty handling closures in certain type contexts, particularly with type ascriptions or complex type expressions. The likely problematic construct here is the use of a closure within an array type length expression, which is not a standard usage pattern and seems to be causing an internal compiler error (ICE).

Mutation Operator:
1. Target Construct: Array type length expressions.
2. Mutation Rule:
   - Identify an array type declaration in the seed program, denoted as `[T; N]` where `T` is the type of the array elements, and `N` is the length of the array.
   - Replace the array length expression `N` with a closure that returns a constant value. For example, replace `N` with `|| 1`.
3. Application Instructions:
   - Locate an array declaration. For instance, `let arr: [i32; 5] = [0; 5];`.
   - Modify the array declaration by changing the array length to a closure. The modified code should look like `let arr: [i32; || 1] = [0; 1];`.
   - Ensure the context supports closures. In cases where closures are not naturally supported, add a function that accepts closures, if necessary, to avoid syntactic errors.
4. Example Transformation:
   Before Mutation:
   ```
   fn example() {
       let numbers: [i32; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
   }
   ```
   After Mutation:
   ```
   fn example() {
       let numbers: [i32; || 3] = [1, 2, 3];
   }
   ```

This mutation explores the boundaries of how closures interact with static type contexts, particularly in array size expressions. This kind of manipulation can help test the robustness of Rust's type checking, especially in less conventional uses cases.
