Mutation Operator: Semicolon Lint Insertion

Target Construct: Macros and Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the macro definition in the seed program, specifically searching for any statements or expressions within the macro that terminate with a semicolon.
2. Identify the use of the macro within async blocks, functions, or any expressions.
3. Apply the `#[warn(semicolon_in_expressions_from_macros)]` attribute to the macro invocation.
4. Insert a trailing semicolon after the macro invocation if not already present.
5. Ensure any existing attributes such as `#[allow]` or `#[expect]` related to semicolon warnings are temporarily removed to observe the effect of the mutation.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
macro_rules! calculate {
    ($val:ident) => {
        $val + 1
    };
}

fn process() {
    let result = calculate!(value);
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
macro_rules! calculate {
    ($val:ident) => {
        $val + 1;
    };
}

fn process() {
    #[warn(semicolon_in_expressions_from_macros)]
    let result = calculate!(value);
}
```

This mutation operator targets macro invocations and their integration with expressions, aiming to induce behavior related to semicolon handling within macros. The goal is to explore lint interaction with macros and observe any unexpected compiler behavior.
