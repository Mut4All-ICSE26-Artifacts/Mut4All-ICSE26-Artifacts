Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Associated Type with Lifetime Constraints

Target: 
The mutation is targeted at the definition of trait associated types that involve lifetime constraints.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the trait definition that uses associated types with lifetime parameters. In the code provided, the target is `trait Trait` with the associated type `type Gat<'lt>;`.
2. Modify the associated type to include additional constraints or change the existing constraints. For example, if the trait has only a single lifetime constraint, add another lifetime parameter and relate them in some manner.
3. Ensure that the associated type's usage throughout the program reflects the additional constraints, modifying any function signatures or type definitions that utilize the trait.

Example:
Consider the original trait definition:
```rust
trait Trait {
    type Gat<'lt>;
}
```
Mutation:
```rust
trait Trait {
    type Gat<'lt, 'newlt>: Iterator + 'lt;
}
```
Application:
1. Find every instance where `Trait::Gat` is used and ensure the function or expression adheres to the new constraints.
2. Adjust function signatures or any related type alias to accommodate the additional lifetime.
3. In `dyn_hoops`, if the `Trait` implementation was using `Gat<'lt>`, it should now use `Gat<'lt, 'b>` where `'b` is a lifetime parameter that could be associated with the function or its inputs.

This mutation aims to explore how the Rust compiler handles increased complexity in lifetime management for generic traits, potentially revealing bugs related to lifetimes and trait bounds.
