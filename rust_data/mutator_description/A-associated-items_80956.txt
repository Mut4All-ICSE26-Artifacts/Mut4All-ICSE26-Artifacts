Mutation Operator: Add Generic Parameter with Lifetime and Trait Bound

Target Code Construct: Top-level function definitions (fn) and inherent method definitions inside impl blocks.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function (either a free-standing function or an inherent method) that has no generic parameters.
2. Introduce a new generic type parameter, such as T_1, to the function signature.
3. Append a where clause with a for<'a>-style high-rank trait bound: T_1: 'a + Sized, where 'a is a newly introduced synthetic lifetime.
4. Ensure the new lifetime is bound using HRTB syntax (for<'a>) to test the compiler's handling of lifetime and trait constraints in generic contexts.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
fn compute(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Mutation:
1. Identify a top-level function with no existing generic parameters and add a new generic type parameter T_1 to the function signature.
2. Add a where clause to constrain T_1 with a higher-ranked trait bound: for<'a> T_1: 'a + Sized.

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn compute<T_1>(x: i32) -> i32
where
    for<'a> T_1: 'a + Sized,
{
    x + 1
}
```

This mutation stresses the compiler’s ability to handle additional generic type parameters combined with high-rank lifetime bounds (for<'a>) and trait constraints (Sized). It is designed to explore lifetime resolution logic, generic bound propagation, and the trait system’s interaction with opaque constraints. This may trigger compiler ICEs, especially in complex generic or dispatch scenarios.
