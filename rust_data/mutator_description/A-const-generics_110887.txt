Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Alias in Const Generics

Target: Trait Alias in Const Generics

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait alias declaration involving a constant expression in the associated types. For example, locate the following structure in the code:
   ```
   trait TraitAlias = ExistingTrait<{ const_expression }>;
   ```

2. Replace the constant expression within the trait alias with a new constant expression that involves a division operation. Ensure that the divisor is a non-zero constant to avoid division by zero errors. For example:
   - Original: `trait TraitAlias = ExistingTrait<{ 2 + 1 }>;`
   - Mutate to: `trait TraitAlias = ExistingTrait<{ 6 / 2 }>;`

3. Apply the mutation to a seed program, ensuring that the new constant expression is syntactically correct and logically valid within the context of the program.

Rationale: This mutation operator targets the constant expression evaluation within trait aliases, which can be a sensitive area in the Rust compiler when dealing with const generics. By altering the constant expression to involve a division operation, it can trigger unexpected behaviors or compiler crashes due to the handling of const generic expressions in trait aliases. This mutation aims to exploit potential weaknesses in the compiler's type inference and const evaluation logic.
