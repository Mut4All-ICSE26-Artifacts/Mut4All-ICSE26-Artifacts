Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics in Function Signature

Target: Function with const generics (e.g., `fn foo<const N: usize>()`)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that uses const generics in its signature.
2. Change the const generic parameter type from one type to another. For instance, change `usize` to `u32`, or any other numeric type, ensuring that the new type is also a valid const generic type.
3. Ensure that the function body and any usages of the function are updated to reflect the new type, maintaining type compatibility where necessary.
4. If the function is used in contexts such as inline assembly, ensure that the change still allows for valid code. If not, introduce an auxiliary constant of the new type and use it accordingly.

Example:
Original:

```rust
fn foo<const N: usize>() {
    // Function body
}
```

Apply Mutation:

```rust
fn foo<const N: u32>() {
    // Adjusted function body if dependent on N's type
}
```

By changing the const generic parameter type, this mutation operator tests the compiler's handling of different types in const generics and ensures robustness against type changes.
