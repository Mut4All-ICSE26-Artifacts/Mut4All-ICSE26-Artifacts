Mutation Operator:
Target: Trait and Implementations with Constant Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition with an associated constant. For example, a trait `TraitName` with `const ASSOC: usize;`.
2. Create multiple `impl` blocks for this trait using different constant generic parameters. Each `impl` should target a different type or a different set of constraints that can leverage the constant generics. For example, `impl<const N: u64> TraitName for [u8; N] {}`.
3. Within one `impl` block, modify the associated constant in a way that it directly uses the constant generic parameter in type-level operations, such as array lengths or type casts, without providing the necessary constraints or ensuring compatibility.
4. Use this trait and `impl` in a function or any context where the compiler will be forced to evaluate the trait constant generically. For example, define a function `fn use_trait() -> [u8; <[u8; 13] as TraitName>::ASSOC] {}` without ensuring that `ASSOC` can be resolved correctly across all implementations.
5. The intention is to create a situation where the const generic parameter is used in a type context that is potentially invalid or leads to ambiguity, provoking the compiler to handle const evaluation improperly.

Example:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    const ASSOC: usize;
}

impl<const M: u64> MyTrait for [u8; M] {}

fn apply_trait() -> [u8; <[u8; 5] as MyTrait>::ASSOC] {
    // Function body, possibly empty
}
```

Instructions:
- Ensure that `M` is used in a way that its resolution relies on the trait's constant, potentially leading to conflicting or unresolved const evaluation.
- The goal is to exploit scenarios where type-level constants and generic parameters interact, particularly aiming at const evaluation and type inference stages in the compiler.
- This mutation is designed to create an inconsistency in how associated constants are handled within constant generic implementations, focusing on causing issues during trait resolution and type-checking phases.
