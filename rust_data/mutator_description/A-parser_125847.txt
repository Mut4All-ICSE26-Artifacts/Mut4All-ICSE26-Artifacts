Mutation Operator

Target Construct: Async Functions with Generic Parameters

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an async function in the seed program that employs generic parameters.
2. Within the functionâ€™s `where` clause, locate any lifetime specification with a `for` syntax.
3. Introduce a generic type constraint that uses a C-style variadic argument in the form of `for<'a> ...: 'a,`.
4. If the seed program does not include a `where` clause for the async function, add one, ensuring to introduce this clause appropriately at the end of the function signature.
5. Ensure the function containing this mutation is included in the call hierarchy to ensure it is processed by the compiler.

Example Pseudo-code:
Before Mutation:
```rust
async fn example_func<T>(param: T) 
where
    T: SomeTrait,
{
    // function body
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
async fn example_func<T>(param: T)
where
    T: SomeTrait,
    for<'a> ...: 'a,
{
    // function body
}
```

This mutation operator targets async functions with generic parameters and modifies the lifetime constraints to use a variadic argument construct, which is likely to expose handling errors in the parser, especially when combined with lifetime specifications.
