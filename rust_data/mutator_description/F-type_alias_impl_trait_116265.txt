Mutation Operator: Alter Type Alias Definition with Trait Bounds

Target: Type Alias with `impl Trait`

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias in the seed program defined with `impl Trait`, such as:
   ```rust
   type T = impl Copy;
   ```
2. Add an additional trait bound to the `impl Trait` statement. The existing trait bound should remain unchanged, and the additional trait must be another common trait that might interact with the existing one, like `Debug` or `Clone`.
3. Modify the type alias definition as follows:
   - Change from:
     ```rust
     type T = impl Copy;
     ```
   - Change to:
     ```rust
     type T = impl Copy + Debug;
     ```

Example in Pseudo-code:
- Original Code:
  ```rust
  fn example_function() {
      type U = impl Clone;
      let bar: U = /* some compatible value */;
  }
  ```
- Mutated Code:
  ```rust
  fn example_function() {
      type U = impl Clone + PartialEq;
      let bar: U = /* same compatible value */;
  }
  ```

This mutation aims to explore the compiler's handling of multiple trait bounds in type aliases using `impl Trait`, potentially revealing issues in trait implementation interactions and coverage of trait methods.
