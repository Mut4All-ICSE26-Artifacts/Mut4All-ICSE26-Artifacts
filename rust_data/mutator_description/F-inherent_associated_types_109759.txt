Mutation Operator:
Target: Structure definitions and implementations involving inherent associated types and const generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition with a const generic parameter, such as `struct Example<const N: usize>;`.
2. Introduce an inherent associated type within an impl block for a different struct. This associated type should also have a const generic parameter.
3. Use this associated type within a function of the struct's impl block, initializing it with a constant value.
4. Modify the constant value to something that is non-standard, like using a non-literal expression that still evaluates to a constant at compile time.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Sample;

struct Example<const N: usize>([(); N]);

impl<const N: usize> Example<N> {
    pub fn create() -> Self {
        Self([(); N])
    }
}

impl Sample {
    type ExampleType<const N: usize> = Example<N>;
}

fn main() {
    let instance = Sample::ExampleType::<10>::create();
}
```

Mutation:
1. Change the initialization value in the main function to a non-standard constant expression, such as `20 / 2`.
2. Modify the main function's call of `create()` by using a complex const expression:

```
fn main() {
    let instance = Sample::ExampleType::<{20 / 2}>::create();
}
```

This mutation operator tests the compiler's handling of complex constant expressions as parameters in conjunction with inherent associated types.
