Mutation Operator: Alter Enum Variants with Arity to Mismatched Types

Target: Enum definitions, particularly those utilized in pattern matching.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum definition in the seed program that is used in a pattern match. The enum should have multiple variants with different arities (number of fields).
2. Introduce a new variant to the enum that has a different arity compared to existing ones, specifically one that is inconsistent with the pattern match expectations.
3. Modify one of the pattern match branches to utilize this new variant, ensuring that the arity of the new variant is deliberately mismatched with the expected arity in the match arm.

Example:
Given an enum `Operation` with the following structure:
```rust
enum Operation {
    Add,
    Subtract(isize),
}
```
Mutation Steps:
1. Add a new variant with a mismatched arity:
   ```rust
   enum Operation {
       Add,              
       Subtract(isize),  
       Multiply(isize, isize) // New variant with two fields
   }
   ```
2. Modify a match statement to use the new variant inappropriately:
   ```rust
   fn calculate(op: Operation) {
       match op {
           Operation::Add => println!("Adding"),
           Operation::Subtract(_) => println!("Subtracting"),
           Operation::Multiply(x) => println!("Multiplying {}", x), // Mismatched arity usage
       }
   }
   ```
3. This introduces a mismatch in the arity expected by the `Multiply` variant, causing the compiler to potentially face arity-related issues similar to those described in the bug.

This mutation operator exploits inconsistencies in pattern matching by deliberately creating situations where the expected number of parameters in a match arm does not align with the provided variant definition, potentially triggering bugs related to pattern arity analysis in the Rust compiler.
