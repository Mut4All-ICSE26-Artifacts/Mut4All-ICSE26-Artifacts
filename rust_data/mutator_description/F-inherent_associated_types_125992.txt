Mutation Operator: Modify Function Signature to Use Inherent Associated Types with Lifetimes

Target: Function signatures that use inherent associated types within structs.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a function that returns a reference with a specified or elided lifetime. In this case, we are targeting the function `ret_ref_local`.

2. Modify the function's return type to use an inherent associated type instead of a direct reference. This involves utilizing a struct's associated type that inherently has a lifetime parameter.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

a. Locate the function definition. Example:
   ```
   fn ret_ref_local<'e>() -> &'e i32 {
       // function body
   }
   ```

b. Identify a struct that has an inherent associated type defined. In this example, the struct `S` with the associated type `P` is available, which is defined as `type P = &'a i32;`.

c. Change the function's return type to use the struct's associated type:
   ```
   fn ret_ref_local<'e>() -> S<'e>::P {
       // function body
   }
   ```

d. Ensure that the function's logic aligns with the new return type. Since `S<'a>::P` is defined as `&'a i32`, the function can remain unchanged if it already returns a compatible reference.

Example of the mutation applied:
```rust
struct S<'a>(&'a ());

impl<'a> S<'a> {
    type P = &'a i32;
}

fn ret_ref_local<'e>() -> S<'e>::P {
    let f: for<'a> fn(&'a i32) -> S<'a>::P = |x| x;
    let local = 0;
    f(&local)
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation deliberately uses inherent associated types in function signatures, which is currently an unstable feature in Rust and prone to compiler bugs, as seen in the provided bug report.
