Mutation Operator: Inject 'static Lifetime in impl Blocks

Target Construct: impl blocks without lifetime parameters, e.g., impl TypeName.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify impl blocks without any lifetime parameters, such as impl Foo or impl<T> Bar<T>.
2. Inject a 'static lifetime parameter into the impl, converting it to impl<'static> Foo or impl<'static, T> Bar<T>.

Example Mutation:
- Original:
  ```rust
  struct Foo;
  impl Foo {
  }
  ```

- Mutated:
  ```rust
  struct Foo;
  impl<'static> Foo {
  }
  ```

Explanation:
- This mutation introduces a 'static lifetime in an impl block where it may not be needed or used,Such changes can lead to lifetime mismatch errors or unexpected compiler behavior if 'static conflicts with lifetime expectations in trait bounds or method signatures,It can trigger internal compiler errors (ICE) in edge cases involving lifetime inference, unused lifetimes, or associated types.
