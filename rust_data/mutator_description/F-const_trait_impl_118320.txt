Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Missing Method

Target Construct: Trait and its Implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition within the seed program. Ensure that the trait has at least one method.
2. Select an existing struct or type that implements this trait.
3. In the implementation of the trait for the selected struct, remove the definition of one or more methods from the trait implementation.
4. Ensure that the method signature(s) removed match with those declared in the trait, to trigger the error due to missing method implementation.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn required_method(&self);
}

struct MyStruct;

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn required_method(&self) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn required_method(&self);
}

struct MyStruct;

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    // Removed required_method implementation to cause a missing method error
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets trait implementations where the implementation is incomplete. By removing a required method from the implementation, it violates the contract of the trait, leading to a compiler error. This kind of mutation can reveal how the compiler handles incomplete trait implementations and could expose vulnerabilities or inconsistencies in trait checking routines.
