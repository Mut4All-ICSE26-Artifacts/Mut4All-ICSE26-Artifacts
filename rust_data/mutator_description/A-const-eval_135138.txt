Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds in Functions

Target: Function definitions with trait bounds

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a function definition that includes a `where` clause specifying trait bounds, such as `fn example() where T: Trait`.
2. Modify the `where` clause to include a trait bound that contradicts or trivially satisfies the trait requirements, such as adding `where T: Sized` for unsized types, or `where T: Send` when `T` is inherently non-thread-safe.
3. Ensure that the type `T` is used within the function in a way that would normally require it to uphold the original trait bound, such as in a type declaration or an operation that requires the trait.
4. The mutation can also involve adding a new function parameter or local variable using existing types from the program, and placing it under an impractical or trivial trait bound.

Example in pseudo-code:
```rust
fn process_data<T>()
where
    T: Sized, // Original bound
{
    let data: T; // Use of T, assuming it requires Sized
    // Function body where T is processed
}

// After mutation:
fn process_data<T>()
where
    T: Unsized, // Contradictory or trivial bound
{
    let data: T; // Use of T
    // Function body remains the same
}
```
This mutation alters trait bounds to create a scenario where the compiler's const-evaluation or layout calculations might encounter unexpected conditions, potentially triggering a bug.
