Mutation Operator

Target: Function Implementation with Union

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a function within an impl block that uses a union.
2. Within this function, locate the union definition.
3. Modify the union by introducing a new field of the same type already present in the union.
4. Change the return type of the function to a tuple containing two elements: Option<T> and Option<U>.
5. Update the function logic to return a tuple where the second element uses the newly added field in the union.

Example:

Original:
```rust
impl<T: Sized> Iterator for S<T> {
    type Item = T;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<<Self as Iterator>::Item> {
        union U {
            a: <Self as Iterator>::Item,
        }
        None
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl<T: Sized> Iterator for S<T> {
    type Item = T;
    fn next(&mut self) -> (Option<<Self as Iterator>::Item>, Option<U>) {
        union U {
            a: <Self as Iterator>::Item,
            b: <Self as Iterator>::Item,
        }
        (None, None)
    }
}
```

This mutation involves modifying union definitions in function logic and altering function return types, both of which are highly prone to triggering compiler bugs related to type inference and normalization, especially in the context of complex type systems and trait implementations.
