Mutation Operator: Modify Lifetime Annotations in Trait Implementations

Target: Implementation of traits with lifetime parameters.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the seed program that involves lifetime annotations, such as `impl<'a> LoadQuery<'a> for &'a u8`.
2. Change the lifetime parameter in the implementation to use a different, non-matching lifetime notation, which would usually result in a mismatch.
3. For example, if the trait method uses a lifetime `'a`, replace it with `'b` or another randomly chosen lifetime that does not match the original.
4. Ensure that this change affects the trait's method signatures, forcing the compiler to resolve lifetime mismatches during the borrow-checking phase.

Example Pseudo-code before Mutation:
```rust
impl<'a> LoadQuery<'a> for &'a u8 {
    type LoadFuture = ();
}
```

Example Pseudo-code after Mutation:
```rust
impl<'a> LoadQuery<'b> for &'a u8 { // Changing the lifetime 'a to 'b
    type LoadFuture = ();
}
```

Rationale:
By altering the lifetime annotations in trait implementations, we introduce potential conflicts and mismatches that are likely to be caught by the borrow checker. This mutation targets the borrow-checking phase, which is where the bug in the original report was identified, and can lead to inconsistencies that cause the compiler to crash. This operator leverages existing code structures and lifetime parameters, ensuring broad applicability and coverage across various seed programs.
