Based on the provided bug report, the Rust compiler bug is triggered by a specific combination of using closure lifetime binders, leading to an Internal Compiler Error (ICE). The issue arises when there's an attempt to normalize a binder for nested closures, which the compiler mishandles, leading to the panic.

Mutation Operator:
1. **Target Code Construct**: Closure within a function
2. **Mutation Rule**:
   a. Identify a closure within a function.
   b. Introduce a nested closure inside the identified closure.
   c. In the nested closure, use a lifetime parameter from the outer closure within its signature.
   d. Ensure that the outer closure uses explicit lifetime parameters in its signature.
3. **Example Description**:
   Original:
   ```
   fn example_function() {
       let closure = || {
           // Closure body
       };
   }
   ```
   Mutated:
   ```
   fn example_function() {
       let closure_outer = for<'a> || -> () {
           let closure_inner = for<'b> |_: &'a i32| -> () {
               // Inner closure body using outer lifetime 'a
           };
           closure_inner(42);
       };
       closure_outer();
   }
   ```
This mutation operator specifically targets the interplay of nested closures with explicit lifetime parameters, which, based on the bug report, is likely to expose similar issues in the compiler. The use of existing function and closure structures ensures that the mutation can be applied to a wide range of seed programs.
