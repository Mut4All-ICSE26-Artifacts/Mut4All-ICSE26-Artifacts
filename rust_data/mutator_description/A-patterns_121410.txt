mutation Operator: Apply incorrect tuple pattern on a non-tuple expression

Target: The mutation operator targets variable patterns specifically in the context of destructuring assignments within functions or closures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a destructuring assignment where a tuple pattern is used to unpack a value. This can typically be found in closure bodies or function blocks.
2. Modify the tuple pattern by applying it to a non-tuple expression, such as a single value or a field of a struct, which is not a tuple. This can involve using a tuple pattern `(a, b)` on a single variable or field that does not support tuple unpacking.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate a closure or function that includes a destructuring assignment with a tuple pattern, such as:
  ```
  let (a, b) = some_tuple;
  ```
- Replace `some_tuple` with a single non-tuple expression. For example, if `some_tuple` is meant to be a field of a struct or a standalone variable, use:
  ```
  let (a, b) = some_variable; // assuming some_variable is not a tuple
  ```
- Ensure that `some_variable` (or similar expressions) is a valid expression in the context but does not produce a tuple.
- The mutation should cause the compiler to handle an invalid pattern matching scenario, potentially leading to a crash or internal compiler error.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct {
    x: u32,
}

let instance = MyStruct { x: 42 };

let closure = || {
    let (a, b) = instance.x; // Attempting to destructure a non-tuple field
};

closure();
```

Mutated Content:
- The closure attempts to destructure `instance.x`, a single `u32` value, using a tuple pattern, which is incorrect and should induce an ICE (Internal Compiler Error) or similar error.
