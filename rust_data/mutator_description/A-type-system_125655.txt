Mutation Operator: Modify Static Definition with Dynamic Trait

Target: Static variable declarations using dynamic traits within functions or modules.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any static variable declaration that uses a dynamic trait, such as `dyn Trait`, within a function or module. For instance, `static variable_name: dyn Trait = ...;`.
2. Change the definition of this static variable to a function definition that returns the same type. This involves:
   - Removing the static keyword and replacing it with a function keyword, such as `fn`.
   - Changing the variable name to a function name.
   - Ensuring the type signature is preserved, but it exists within the function return type definition.
   - Keeping the body of the static variable assignment as the body of the new function, ensuring the return statement aligns with the return type. 

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn main() {
    static foo: dyn Fn() -> u32 = || -> u32 { 0 };
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn main() {
    fn foo() -> Box<dyn Fn() -> u32> {
        Box::new(|| -> u32 { 0 })
    }
}
```

Notes:
- Ensure the body logic and return type are valid within a function context.
- This mutation is particularly relevant to test how the compiler handles dynamic trait objects when they are misused in a static context versus a function context.
- This mutation can reveal inconsistencies or limitations in how dynamic traits are translated during compilation.
- The mutation uses existing logic and returns a boxed trait object to ensure correct ownership semantics.
