Mutation Operator: Modify Function Signature to Introduce Trait Bounds

Target Construct: Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that uses generic type parameters.
2. Modify the function signature to introduce an additional trait bound on one of the existing generic type parameters.
3. Ensure the added trait is commonly used and widely available in Rust, such as `Clone`, `Debug`, or `Send`.
4. If no generic type parameters exist, introduce a new generic type parameter with a trait bound.

Example:
Original Function:
```rust
fn process_data<T>(data: T) {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated Function:
```rust
fn process_data<T: Clone>(data: T) {
    // function body
}
```

Explanation:
By introducing or modifying trait bounds on generic type parameters, the mutation can lead to scenarios where the existing code might no longer satisfy the new constraints. This can uncover hidden assumptions about type behavior and trigger issues in areas such as type inference, trait resolution, or monomorphization, which are critical paths in the Rust compiler.
