Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics in Struct Declarations

Target: This mutation operator targets struct definitions using const generics.

Mutation Rule: Modify the const generic default value by introducing a dependency on another const generic parameter within the same struct, creating a nested or recursive dependency.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a struct definition that uses const generics with default values. For example, a struct that has `const N: usize = { const {3} }`.
2. Introduce an additional const generic parameter, say `const M: usize`, to the struct. Ensure this parameter is used in a way that depends on another const generic parameter.
3. Modify the default value of the original const generic parameter to depend on this new parameter in a non-trivial manner, such as using it in an arithmetic expression or through a function call that involves recursion or complex constraints.

Example:
Original Struct:
```rust
pub struct ConstDefaultUnstable<const N: usize = { const {3} }>;
```

Mutated Struct:
```rust
pub struct ConstDefaultUnstable<const N: usize = { M + 1 }, const M: usize = 2>;
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, a new const generic parameter `M` is introduced. The default value of `N` is changed to depend on `M` by adding 1 to `M`. This kind of modification can lead to complex type-checking during compilation, potentially exposing bugs related to const generics.
