Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Const Expression in Trait Implementation

Target: The target of this mutation is a trait implementation that uses a constant expression in a generic context, specifically involving structs or traits that utilize `const N: usize`.

Mutation Rule: 

1. Identify a struct or trait implementation that involves a constant expression in generics, for example, `impl<I: Indices<N>, J: Indices<N>, const N: usize> Mul for Tensor<I, N>`.

2. Modify the constant expression by introducing a complex const expression that involves arithmetic operations or invalid operations such as division by zero or accessing negative indices. For example, replace `const N: usize` with `const N: usize = {2 + 3 - (5 * 0)}` or `const N: usize = {0 - 1}`.

3. Ensure the mutation adheres to the Rust type system by maintaining valid syntax. If introducing new constants, declare them appropriately inline within the existing scope using `const` keyword.

4. If the current seed program has an associated function or struct that uses the constant value, replace its usage with the mutated constant value. For example, if there's a function using `N`, replace its invocation with the mutated constant expression.

Example:

Before Mutation:
```
impl<I: Indices<N>, J: Indices<N>, const N: usize> Mul for Tensor<I, N>
```

After Mutation:
```
impl<I: Indices<N>, J: Indices<N>, const N: usize = {2 * (3 - 1) / 0}> Mul for Tensor<I, N>
```

This mutation can potentially trigger compiler bugs related to constant evaluation and type checking, especially in the presence of arithmetic operations leading to undefined or invalid values.
