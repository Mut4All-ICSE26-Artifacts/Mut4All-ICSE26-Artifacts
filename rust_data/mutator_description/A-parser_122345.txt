Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Call Expressions
Applicable To: Function call expressions involving complex or malformed type specifications.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify function call expressions that involve type specifications, particularly those using "::" for type qualification.
2. Modify the type specification to introduce potentially malformed or unexpected type structures that mimic the issue in the bug report, which involves an unexpected token.
3. Specifically, replace valid type paths with unexpected constructs or token sequences to trigger parsing errors.

Example:
Given a function call in the seed program like:
```
my_function(ptr, Layout::new<MyType>(1, 1));
```

Apply the mutation as follows:
1. Identify the type specification `Layout::new<MyType>`.
2. Introduce an unexpected construct by replacing it with something like `Layout::(x: !)(1, 1)`.
3. The mutated function call becomes:
```
my_function(ptr, Layout::(x: !)(1, 1));
```

Explanation:
- This mutation introduces a malformed type specification that mimics the unexpected token sequence found in the bug report.
- The goal is to trigger a parsing issue in the compiler by using an unexpected construct in place of a valid type path.
- This mutation is designed to exploit potential weaknesses in the parser's handling of type specifications and path segments.
