Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Representation for Alignment

Target: Enum with Representation Attributes

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any enum type with a `#[repr(C, packed(N))]` attribute, where `N` is a packing alignment.
2. Change the `packed(N)` attribute to a different alignment value or remove it entirely. This mutation targets alignment mismatches between ABI and layout.
3. If removing `packed(N)`, replace it with either:
   - `#[repr(C)]` to maintain a C-compatible layout without specific packing.
   - `#[repr(C, align(M))]` where `M` is a power of two and different from `N`, to test different alignment strategies.

Example:
Given the original code:
```rust
#[repr(C, packed(2))]
enum V0usize {
    V,
}
```
Apply the mutation:
```rust
#[repr(C)] // or #[repr(C, align(4))]
enum V0usize {
    V,
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets alignment attributes of enum representation in Rust. By altering or removing the packing specification, it can reveal potential issues in how the Rust compiler handles alignment, potentially triggering bugs related to ABI and layout mismatches.
