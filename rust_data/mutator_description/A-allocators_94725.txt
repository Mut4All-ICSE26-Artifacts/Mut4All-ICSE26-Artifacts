Mutation Operator: Modify Box Allocator Type

Target: The Box type in the Rust code, specifically focusing on its allocator type parameter.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the Box instantiation in the code, e.g., `Box::<i32, &ZST>::new_in(43, &ZST);`.
2. Change the existing allocator type parameter to `std::alloc::Global`. For example, modify `Box::<i32, &ZST>` to `Box::<i32, std::alloc::Global>`.
3. Adjust the `new_in` method call to use the default allocation behavior, which does not require a second argument, as follows: `Box::<i32, std::alloc::Global>::new(43);`.

Explanation:
This mutation operator modifies the choice of allocator used by Box. By switching from a custom allocator (e.g., `&ZST`) to the global allocator (`std::alloc::Global`), we can explore how the compiler processes standard versus custom allocators. This can help trigger bugs related to allocator API implementation or interactions with the debuginfo subsystem, which was part of the original bug report. This mutation maintains compatibility with existing code structures while exploring different code paths in the compiler.
