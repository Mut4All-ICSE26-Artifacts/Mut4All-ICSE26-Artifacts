Mutation Operator: Introduce Nested Local Struct Derivation

Target Code Construct: Struct declaration within function bodies, specifically inside `impl` blocks that utilize procedural macros such as `#[derive(...)]`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition within a function body that is located inside an `impl` block.
2. Check if the struct uses `#[derive(...)]` with procedural macros like `serde::Deserialize`.
3. Modify the code by introducing an additional nested struct within the identified struct and apply the same derive attribute.

Steps:
- Locate any function within an `impl` block that contains a struct definition using `#[derive(...)]`.
- Inside this struct, define a new nested struct, ensuring it is valid within the Rust syntax.
- Apply the same `#[derive(...)]` attribute to this new nested struct.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl<'de> serde::Deserialize<'de> for AB {
    fn deserialize<D>(_deserializer: D) -> Result<Self, D::Error>
    where
        D: serde::Deserializer<'de>,
    {
        #[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
        struct A2 {}
        
        return Ok(AB{})
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl<'de> serde::Deserialize<'de> for AB {
    fn deserialize<D>(_deserializer: D) -> Result<Self, D::Error>
    where
        D: serde::Deserializer<'de>,
    {
        #[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
        struct A2 {
            #[derive(serde::Deserialize)]
            struct A3 {}
        }
        
        return Ok(AB{})
    }
}
```

This mutation operator potentially triggers stack overflow issues by increasing the complexity of the procedural macro evaluation due to recursive derive handling within nested structures.
