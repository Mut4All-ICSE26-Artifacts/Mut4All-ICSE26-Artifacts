Mutation Operator: Modify Opaque Type Usage in Function Signatures

Target Construct: Functions using opaque types (impl Trait), especially in type aliases.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function or method that uses an opaque type through a type alias, such as `type Foo = impl SomeTrait;`.
2. Locate the function signature where this type alias is used, either directly or indirectly.
3. Modify the signature to explicitly mention the opaque type without using the alias. If `impl Trait` is involved in a type alias, ensure that the trait is mentioned directly in the function signature.
4. Ensure the function still respects trait bounds by adding constraints if necessary. If the function signature is `fn example(arg: Foo)`, transform it into `fn example<T: SomeTrait>(arg: T)`.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
type Foo = impl Send;

fn process_data(data: Foo) {
    // function body
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
fn process_data<T: Send>(data: T) {
    // function body
}
```

This mutation aims to trigger potential issues related to how the Rust compiler handles impl Trait in type aliases, forcing the compiler to explicitly work with trait bounds.
