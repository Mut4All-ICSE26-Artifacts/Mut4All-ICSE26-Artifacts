Mutation Operator: Pointer Arithmetic with Type Casting

Target Construct: This mutation operator targets pointer arithmetic operations in combination with type casting. It applies to any Rust code where pointers are involved, especially when using unsafe blocks to manipulate pointers.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a block of code where pointer arithmetic is performed, especially in an unsafe context.
2. Replace direct pointer arithmetic with a combination of arithmetic and type casting to a different pointer type.
3. Insert a step that involves casting a pointer to a usize, performing arithmetic on the usize, and then casting it back to the original pointer type.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a pointer arithmetic operation within an unsafe block. For example, `ptr.add(offset)`.
- Introduce a variable to hold the usize representation of the pointer: `let ptr_as_usize = ptr as usize;`
- Perform the arithmetic on the usize: `let new_address = ptr_as_usize + offset;`
- Cast the usize back to the pointer type: `let new_ptr = new_address as *const T;`
- Use the new pointer in place of the old arithmetic operation.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
unsafe {
    let ptr = &value as *const i32;
    let new_ptr = ptr.add(1);
    assert_eq!(*new_ptr, expected_value);
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
unsafe {
    let ptr = &value as *const i32;
    let ptr_as_usize = ptr as usize;
    let new_address = ptr_as_usize + 1 * std::mem::size_of::<i32>();
    let new_ptr = new_address as *const i32;
    assert_eq!(*new_ptr, expected_value);
}
```

This mutation operator increases the likelihood of encountering edge cases related to pointer arithmetic and type casting, which are common triggers for compiler bugs, particularly those related to memory and type safety.
