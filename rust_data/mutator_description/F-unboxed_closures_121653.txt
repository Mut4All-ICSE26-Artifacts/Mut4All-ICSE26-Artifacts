Mutation Operator 1: Modify Closure Invocation and Output

Target: Trait Implementations with Unboxed Closures

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation where the trait is implemented for a type `T` that involves unboxed closures.
2. Within the implementation, locate the function where the closure is invoked. For example, in the provided code, the line is `(self)(&());` inside the `dispatch` method.
3. Modify the closure invocation by introducing an additional layer of wrapping or altering the expected function signature in a way that might not align with the traits' expected `Output`.
4. For instance, replace `(self)(&());` with `let _ = async { (self)(&()); };` to introduce a higher-ranked trait bound or different async construct.

Example:

Before Mutation:
```rust
impl<T: for<'a> Fn<(&'a (),)>> Dispatch for T
where
    for<'a> <T as FnOnce<(&'a (),)>>::Output: Future,
{
    fn dispatch(self) {
        (self)(&());
    }
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
impl<T: for<'a> Fn<(&'a (),)>> Dispatch for T
where
    for<'a> <T as FnOnce<(&'a (),)>>::Output: Future,
{
    fn dispatch(self) {
        let _ = async { (self)(&()); };
    }
}
```

This mutation leverages the existing closure and its invocation but introduces a new async context that potentially complicates the future resolution, targeting the compiler's trait selection and monomorphization logic.
