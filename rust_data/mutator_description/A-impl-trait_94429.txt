Mutation Operator: Modify Generator Usage in Trait and Implementations

Target Construct: Trait and Impl blocks that use the Generator trait.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify traits in the code that have associated types defined as `impl Generator<Yield = (), Return = ()>`.
2. Mutate the associated type to use a different `Yield` or `Return` type unexpectedly.
3. Update the corresponding implementation to match the modified associated type but intentionally introduce a mismatch in runtime behavior.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the trait where the type alias `impl Generator` is used. Example:
  ```rust
  trait Runnable {
      type Gen: Generator<Yield = (), Return = ()>;
      fn run(&mut self) -> Self::Gen;
  }
  ```

- Modify the associated type `Gen` to yield a different type, such as:
  ```rust
  trait Runnable {
      type Gen: Generator<Yield = u32, Return = String>;
  }
  ```

- Adjust the implementation to match the new associated type but introduce a mismatch:
  ```rust
  impl Runnable for Implementor {
      type Gen = impl Generator<Yield = u32, Return = String>;

      fn run(&mut self) -> Self::Gen {
          move || {
              yield 1;  // Mismatch here if logic expects ()
              return "done".to_string(); // Correct return but logic issue.
          }
      }
  }
  ```

- Ensure the types used in the mutations are declared if they are not already present in the seed program.

Rationale:
This mutation operator targets the mismatch between the expected generator yield and return types and the actual implementation logic, focusing on the `Generator` trait usage in traits and their implementations. The intent is to trigger bugs related to type inference and generator logic handling in the Rust compiler.
