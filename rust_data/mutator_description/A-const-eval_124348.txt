Mutation Operator: Modify Constant Array Type

Target: This mutation operator targets constant array declarations in Rust code, specifically altering their element type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constant array declaration in the code, such as `const ARR: &[Type] = ...;`.
2. Change the array's element type from a concrete type to a trait object type to introduce type complexity.
3. Ensure the modified type is compatible with elements being used in the array.

Example:
Given Code:
```rust
const EEK_ZERO: &[Eek] = &[];
```

Mutation:
1. Change the type of `EEK_ZERO` from `&[Eek]` to `&[dyn Trait]`, where `Trait` is an existing trait implemented by the type being used in the array (e.g., `PartialEq` if `Eek` implements it).

Modified Code:
```rust
const EEK_ZERO: &[dyn PartialEq] = &[];
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces a change where the array now holds trait objects, increasing the complexity for the const evaluator during compilation. This can expose bugs related to type coercion and trait object handling within the constant evaluation logic of the Rust compiler. This mutation is highly applicable as it leverages existing structures and types, ensuring a broad coverage by affecting how types are handled in constant contexts.
