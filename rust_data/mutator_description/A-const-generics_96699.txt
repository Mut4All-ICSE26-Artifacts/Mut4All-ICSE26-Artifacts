Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Constraints with Const Generics

Target: This mutation operator targets trait definitions with associated functions or types that involve const generics and where clauses.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition that includes a where clause with constraints on the trait's associated types or functions.
2. Within the where clause, introduce a const generic expression involving the min function or any other const fn that operates on generic constants.
3. Modify the trait's associated type or function to use this new const generic expression, ensuring it is valid within the context of the existing Rust code.
4. Adjust any implementation blocks to reflect changes made to the trait definition, ensuring that the implementations adhere to the new const generic constraints.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait<T>
where
    Self: Sized,
{
    type AssocType;

    fn example_function()
    where
        T: Default,
    {
        T::default();
    }
}
```

Mutation:
1. Add a const generic parameter to the trait `ExampleTrait`.
2. Introduce a const fn expression in the where clause.

Mutated Code:
```rust
const fn compute_min(x: usize, y: usize) -> usize {
    if x < y { x } else { y }
}

trait ExampleTrait<T, const X: usize, const Y: usize>
where
    Self: Sized,
    [(); compute_min(X, Y)]:,
{
    type AssocType: Default;

    fn example_function()
    where
        T: Default,
    {
        T::default();
    }
}
```
