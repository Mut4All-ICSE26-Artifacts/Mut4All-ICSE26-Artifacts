Mutation Operator: Modify Inline Assembly Code

Target: Inline assembly blocks within function bodies.

Step-by-step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that includes an inline assembly block using the `asm!` macro.
2. Locate the assembly instructions inside the `asm!` macro. For example, in the given bug report, the instructions are `"lea rax, [rdi + rsi]", "ret"`.
3. Modify the assembly instructions to use an operand that is out of bounds or does not align with expected operand types. This can be achieved by:
   a. Adding an index or register operand that is not defined or expected within the context of the function.
   b. Altering the instruction to use a non-existent or unallocated register.
4. Ensure that the modified assembly block still adheres to the syntax allowed by the inline assembly feature in Rust (e.g., properly quoted strings and valid assembly syntax).

Example:
Given Original Inline Assembly:
```rust
asm!("lea rax, [rdi + rsi]", "ret", options(noreturn));
```

Mutated Inline Assembly:
```rust
asm!("lea rax, [rdi + rcx]", "ret", options(noreturn));
```
In this mutation, `rcx` is introduced as an operand that might not have been set up correctly, potentially leading to issues with operand bounds or type mismatches, thereby triggering potential compiler bugs related to inline assembly handling.
