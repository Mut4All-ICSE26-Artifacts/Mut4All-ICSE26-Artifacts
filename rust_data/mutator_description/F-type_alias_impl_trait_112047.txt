Mutation Operator: Recursive Trait Method Call Mutation

Target: Traits and trait method implementations

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a trait that contains an async method. For example, a trait `ExampleTrait` with an async method `async_fn`.
2. Check if there is an existing implementation of this trait for a concrete type or a generic type with trait bounds.
3. In the implementation of the async method, introduce an indirect recursive call chain:
   a. Within the `async_fn` implementation, call another method (either from the same trait or another trait that the type implements) that eventually triggers a call back to `async_fn` asynchronously.
   b. Ensure that the method call chain involves at least one `.await` point that will resume back into the original trait method, creating a cycle.
4. Make sure that the recursive interaction involves multiple traits if possible, relying on their respective async methods, similar to the interaction between `First` and `Second` traits in the provided bug example.
5. If necessary, declare any additional traits or methods that create a meaningful chain, ensuring they adhere to Rust's syntax rules.

Example:
```rust
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    type Other: OtherTrait;
    async fn async_fn(self) -> Self::Other;
}

struct Example;

impl ExampleTrait for Example {
    type Other = Example;
    async fn async_fn(self) -> Self::Other {
        self.other_fn().await
    }
}

pub trait OtherTrait {
    async fn other_fn(self);
}

impl<T> OtherTrait for T
where
    T: ExampleTrait,
{
    async fn other_fn(self) {
        self.async_fn().await;
    }
}
```
This creates an indirect recursive call between `async_fn` and `other_fn`, similar to the interaction between `First` and `Second` in the bug report.
