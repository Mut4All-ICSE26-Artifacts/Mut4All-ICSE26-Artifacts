Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation Const Generics

Target Construct: Trait Implementation with Const Generics

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait implementation that uses const generics, similar to `impl<'a, const N: usize> X for [(); N] {}` in the given code.

2. Change the const generic parameter type or its constraint to a different valid type or constraint. For instance, change `const N: usize` to `const N: u32`.

3. Apply this change uniformly across the implementation to ensure consistency.

Example (Pseudo-code):

Original:
```rust
impl<'a, const N: usize> TraitName for [(); N] {
    // implementation details
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl<'a, const N: u32> TraitName for [(); N] {
    // implementation details
}
```

Explanation:
This operator targets the trait implementation of arrays using const generics. By altering the type or constraints of const generics, it can explore edge cases in specialization or resolution logic within the Rust compiler. This mutation is likely to expose inconsistencies or bugs related to how the compiler handles different numeric types in const generics, potentially triggering internal compiler errors or unexpected behavior.
