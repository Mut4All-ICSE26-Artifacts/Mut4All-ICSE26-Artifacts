Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Definition and Implementation

This mutation operator targets a specific construct in Rust programs: Traits and their implementations. The goal is to trigger potential compiler bugs by creating inconsistencies between trait definitions and their implementations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that includes function signatures with associated types or where clauses.
2. Modify the trait by adding a new method with an associated type or where clause that is not implemented in the existing structs or enums implementing the trait.
3. Ensure the new method has a signature that requires the use of a type or trait not currently in scope, such as adding a dependency on a non-imported standard library trait.
4. Do not modify existing functions in the trait or their implementations, only add new ones.
5. Example of mutation:
   - Original trait:
     ```
     trait ExampleTrait {
         fn example_method(&self, value: i32);
     }
     ```
   - Modified trait:
     ```
     trait ExampleTrait {
         fn example_method(&self, value: i32);
         fn new_method(&self) -> impl std::fmt::Display; // Requires std::fmt::Display
     }
     ```
6. Implement new method in the trait's implementation, potentially missing necessary imports:
   - Implementation:
     ```
     impl ExampleTrait for SomeStruct {
         fn example_method(&self, value: i32) {
             // existing implementation
         }
         fn new_method(&self) -> impl std::fmt::Display { "example" }
     }
     ```
7. This mutation should be carefully crafted to introduce potential conflicts or missing trait implementations that could lead to compiler errors or unexpected behavior. The use of traits and associated types should reflect real-world scenarios for maximal impact and coverage.
