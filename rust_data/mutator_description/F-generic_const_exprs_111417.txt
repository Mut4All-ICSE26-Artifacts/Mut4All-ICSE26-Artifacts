Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bound with Generic Const Expressions

Target: Applies to function signatures where traits are used with generic const expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that returns a reference to a trait object with generic const expressions.
2. Locate the trait bound that involves a generic const expression.
3. Modify the const expression used in the trait bound to use different arithmetic operations or logical conditions.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn example<'a, T>() -> &'static dyn MyTrait<[(); { |x: &'a u32| { x }; 4 }]> {
    todo!()
}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Identify the const expression `{ |x: &'a u32| { x }; 4 }` within the trait bound `MyTrait<[(); { |x: &'a u32| { x }; 4 }]>`.
2. Modify the const expression to use a different logic or arithmetic operation:
   - Change `4` to another arithmetic expression, such as `4 + 1`.
3. The mutated trait bound becomes `MyTrait<[(); { |x: &'a u32| { x }; 4 + 1 }]>`.

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn example<'a, T>() -> &'static dyn MyTrait<[(); { |x: &'a u32| { x }; 4 + 1 }]> {
    todo!()
}
```

This mutation targets the use of generic const expressions within trait bounds, changing the arithmetic logic to test the compiler's handling of const expression evaluation in traits.
