Mutation Operator
Target: Macro Invocation with Variable Declarations
Applies to: Macro invocations within Rust code, specifically targeting variable declarations within macros.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate any macro invocation within the seed program where a macro is defined to accept statements or expressions (`$s:stmt` or similar patterns in `macro_rules!`).
2. Replace a valid variable declaration inside the macro with an invalid one by omitting the keyword `let` or `const` and using an invalid keyword or no keyword at all.
3. Ensure that the modified macro call still uses syntax that is parsable by Rust but semantically incorrect, such as using `var` instead of `let`.

Example:
Original Seed Code:
```
macro_rules! example_macro { ($s:stmt) => { $s } }
example_macro! { let y = 10; }
```

Mutated Content:
```
macro_rules! example_macro { ($s:stmt) => { $s } }
example_macro! { var y = 10; }
```

This mutation introduces a semantic error by attempting to declare a variable with an undefined keyword within a macro, which can cause the parser to misbehave and potentially crash, similar to the reported bug.
