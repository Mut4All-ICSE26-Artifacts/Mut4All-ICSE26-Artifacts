Mutation Operator: Add an Unelided Lifetime in Trait Methods

Target: Trait methods with associated type bounds and return-position `impl Trait`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that has methods returning `impl Trait` with associated types.
2. Locate the return type of a method declared with `impl Trait`, specifically one involving associated type bounds.
3. Introduce an unelided lifetime in the associated type constraint within the return type, ensuring it uses a lifetime parameter not defined within the method or trait.
4. Ensure the mutation does not introduce undeclared elements. If necessary, introduce the new lifetime in the trait's method signature.

Example:
Original Seed Code:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    type AssociatedType;

    fn example_method(&self) -> impl ExampleTrait<AssociatedType>;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    type AssociatedType;

    fn example_method(&self) -> impl ExampleTrait<AssociatedType: 'lifetime>;
}
```

In this example, `'lifetime` is a placeholder for a new, unelided lifetime that is introduced in the method's return type without being declared in the function or trait's lifetime parameters. This mutation targets the subtle handling of lifetimes in the Rust compiler, potentially exposing issues similar to those seen in the bug report.
