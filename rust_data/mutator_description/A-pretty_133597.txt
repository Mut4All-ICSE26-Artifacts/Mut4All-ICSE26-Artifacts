Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Function Signature with Lifetime Annotations

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets trait function signatures, particularly those with lifetime annotations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait function signature within the seed program. This function should include lifetime annotations.
2. Modify the lifetime annotations by adding a redundant self-referential lifetime constraint.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a trait `MyTrait` with a function signature `fn my_function<'a>() -> &'a SomeType;`.
- Change the function signature by introducing a self-referential lifetime constraint that is redundant. For instance, transform `fn my_function<'a>() -> &'a SomeType;` into `fn my_function<'a: 'a>() -> &'a SomeType;`.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    fn example_function<'b>() -> &'b SomeType;
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
pub trait ExampleTrait {
    fn example_function<'b: 'b>() -> &'b SomeType;
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation adds a redundant self-referential constraint, `'b: 'b`, which can potentially trigger bugs related to lifetime handling in trait function signatures. The mutation is subtle and leverages existing lifetime annotations, increasing the likelihood of exposing compiler bugs related to lifetime checks and constraints.
