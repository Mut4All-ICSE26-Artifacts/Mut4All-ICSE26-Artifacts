Mutation Operator: Inherent Associated Type Redundancy

Target: Structs with inherent associated types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that uses inherent associated types.
2. Declare an inherent associated type with a name identical to an existing type alias or struct member type within the same impl block.
3. Ensure that the newly declared associated type has a generic lifetime parameter identical to the struct's lifetime.
4. Avoid changing line numbers or introducing new structs or functions.

Mutation Steps:
- Locate a struct definition with inherent associated types, such as:
  ```rust
  struct S<'a>(&'a ());
  
  impl<'a> S<'a> {
      type P = &'a i32;
  }
  ```
- Introduce an identical associated type declaration in a new impl block for the same struct:
  ```rust
  impl<'a> S<'a> {
      type P = &'a i32;  // Redundant declaration
  }
  ```

Expected Result:
This mutation can lead to unexpected behavior in the Rust compiler's type-checking process, potentially causing internal errors related to type parameter substitution and lifetime conflicts, especially in the context of associated types with generic lifetimes.
