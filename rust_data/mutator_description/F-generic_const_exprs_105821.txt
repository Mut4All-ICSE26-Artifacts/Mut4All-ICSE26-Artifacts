Mutation Operator:
Target: Union types with const generic parameters
Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the union definition which uses const generic parameters. In the given example, this is the `ConcatJoiner` union.
2. Identify the conditional where clause using `const` generic parameters (e.g., `[(); N + M]:`).
3. Introduce a new conditional dependency by adding an additional where clause using an additional arithmetic operation or a different combination of the existing parameters. For instance, add an extra constraint that involves a mathematical operation or a logical operation on existing parameters.
4. Ensure the new constraint creates an unsatisfiable condition, or conflicts with existing constraints. For example, add a where clause [(); N * M]:, assuming the multiplication would lead to a size mismatch or push the size beyond possible limits.
5. Recompile the program to trigger potential errors related to constraint validation within the union, leveraging the complexity of const generics.
