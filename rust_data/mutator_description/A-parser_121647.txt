Mutation Operator:
Target: Macro invocation within function bodies.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a macro invocation within a function body. In the given bug report, this is `the_macro!( (); (); );`.
2. Alter the macro rules to include additional attributes or conditions that are not expected, potentially conflicting with existing conditions.
3. For example, modify the macro to add another configuration condition to the statement block:
   
   Original macro:
   ```
   macro_rules! the_macro {
       ( $foo:stmt ; $bar:stmt ; ) => {
           #[cfg()]
           $foo

           #[cfg(bar)]
           $bar
       };
   }
   ```

   Mutated macro:
   ```
   macro_rules! the_macro {
       ( $foo:stmt ; $bar:stmt ; ) => {
           #[cfg()]
           $foo

           #[cfg(bar)]
           $bar

           // Add an unexpected cfg attribute
           #[cfg(unexpected)]
           $foo
       };
   }
   ```

4. Invoke this mutated macro within a function, ensuring the function structure remains unchanged except for the macro invocation:

   ```
   fn the_function() {
       the_macro!( (); (); );
   }
   ```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets the use of macros with conditional attributes. By introducing an unexpected `cfg` attribute in the macro definition, it explores potential parser ambiguities or misinterpretations, which could lead to internal errors similar to those in the bug report. This operator leverages existing macro and function constructs and only requires the addition of an attribute, ensuring broad applicability without introducing new elements.
