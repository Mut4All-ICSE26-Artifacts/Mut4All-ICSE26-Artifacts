Mutation Operator: Modify Trait and Impl Definition with Invalid Lifetime Resolution

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets trait definitions and function signatures involving trait objects with complex lifetime and type parameter usage.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition in the seed program. Example: `trait MyTrait<T> { ... }`.

2. Identify a function or method signature that uses the trait with lifetime and type parameters. It should contain complex or nested usage of trait bounds, generic parameters, and lifetimes. Example: `fn my_func(x: impl for<'a> MyTrait<'a, T = impl MyTrait<U> + 'a>) { ... }`.

3. Apply the following mutation to the identified function or method signature:
   a. Replace the generic parameter and trait bound in the function signature to introduce conflicting or unresolved lifetimes. 
   b. Specifically, manipulate the usage of `impl Trait` and associated type bindings to create a lifetime mismatch or ambiguity. 
   c. Example change: 
      - Original: `impl for<'a> MyTrait<'a, T = impl MyTrait<U> + 'a>`
      - Mutated: `impl for<'b> MyTrait<'b, T = impl MyTrait<'c> + 'd>`

4. Ensure that the replacement introduces a scenario where the Rust compiler struggles to resolve the introduced lifetimes, causing an inconsistency or internal error related to lifetime resolution.

5. The result should be a mutation that can lead to an ICE (Internal Compiler Error) or a similar critical error in the compiler, specifically targeting the lifetime and trait resolution logic.

By focusing on complex trait bounds and lifetime mismatches, this mutation operator leverages a known area of difficulty for the Rust compiler, increasing the likelihood of uncovering an ICE.
