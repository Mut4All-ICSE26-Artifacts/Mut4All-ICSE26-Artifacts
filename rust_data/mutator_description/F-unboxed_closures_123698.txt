Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Type Bounds and Traits

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing function that uses trait bounds with custom traits or Rust's standard library traits. For example, functions using traits like `FnOnce`, `Fn`, or `AsyncFnOnce`.
2. Change the trait bound from a valid trait to a different trait that the function is not designed to work with.
3. Ensure that the new trait is one that might interact incorrectly with the existing function signature, particularly those involving lifetimes and contexts, such as using an async trait or closure trait in a non-async context.
4. Modify the function signature to incorporate the new trait, keeping the input parameters the same, but altering the functionality implied by the trait change.

Example:
Suppose there is a function defined as follows:
```rust
fn example_function<F>(f: F)
where
    F: FnOnce(),
{
    // function body
}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Change the trait bound `FnOnce` to `AsyncFnOnce`, altering the expected use context.
2. The function signature after mutation would be:
   ```rust
   fn example_function<F>(f: F)
   where
       F: AsyncFnOnce(),
   {
       // function body
   }
   ```

Rationale:
This mutation targets the type system's handling of traits and context-specific behaviors such as async execution. By changing the trait from `FnOnce` to `AsyncFnOnce`, we introduce a scenario where the function must handle asynchronous execution capabilities, potentially revealing issues with trait resolution and type checking in the Rust compiler, especially in scenarios involving unboxed closures or other advanced features. This mutation is based on the understanding that subtle changes in trait bounds can have cascading effects on type inference and execution flow in Rust, leading to internal compiler errors (ICE) if not handled properly.
