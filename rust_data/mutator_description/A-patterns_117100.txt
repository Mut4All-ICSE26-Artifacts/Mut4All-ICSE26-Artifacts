Mutation Operator:
Target: The mutation operator targets type alias definitions using `impl Trait` and their usage in match expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the type alias declaration using `impl Trait`. For example, `type T = impl Copy;`.
2. Replace the type alias usage in variable declarations with direct usage of a concrete type. For example, if `let foo: T = Some((1u32, 2u32));` is using `T`, replace `T` with `Option<(u32, u32)>` or any other concrete type that matches the pattern's variants.
3. Ensure that any match expression using the previous variable correctly patterns against the new concrete type. For instance, if the original match was:
   ```
   match foo {
       None => (),
       Some((a, b)) => (),
   }
   ```
   No changes would be needed if `foo` now has the type `Option<(u32, u32)>`.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn example() {
    type T = impl Copy;
    let foo: T = Some((1u32, 2u32));
    match foo {
        None => (),
        Some((a, b)) => (),
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn example() {
    let foo: Option<(u32, u32)> = Some((1u32, 2u32));
    match foo {
        None => (),
        Some((a, b)) => (),
    }
}
```

By directly replacing type aliases with their resolved types, this mutation operator may reveal discrepancies in pattern matching and type handling, potentially triggering compiler inconsistencies or errors.
