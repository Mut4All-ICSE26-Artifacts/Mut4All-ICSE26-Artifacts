Mutation Operator 1: Modify Lifetime Annotations in Trait Implementations

Target: Trait implementations with lifetime parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that has lifetime parameters. In this case, locate the trait `Trait` defined as `trait Trait<'a, 'b> {}`.
2. Find an implementation of this trait for a type. Note the lifetime parameters used in the implementation, such as `impl<'a, 'b, T> Trait<'a, 'b> for T {}`.
3. Modify the lifetime parameters in the implementation by introducing a non-universal lifetime region that doesn't adhere to the generic lifetime parameters of the function where this trait is implemented.
4. Replace the existing lifetime parameters with a new sequence that intentionally causes mismatch or non-universality. For example, change `impl<'a, 'b, T> Trait<'a, 'b> for T` to `impl<'c, 'd, T> Trait<'c, 'd> for T` where `'c` and `'d` do not correspond to any universal lifetime in the context.
5. Recompile the code to check for errors or warnings related to the mutation of lifetime parameters.

Example:
Original:
```rust
impl<'a, 'b, T> Trait<'a, 'b> for T {}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl<'c, 'd, T> Trait<'c, 'd> for T {}
```

Explanation:
This operator specifically focuses on the lifetime parameters used in trait implementations. By changing these parameters to different, potentially non-corresponding lifetimes, it can trigger issues related to lifetime mismatches, leading to internal compiler errors when the non-universal regions cannot be resolved or inferred. This mutation takes advantage of the complexity of lifetime management in Rust, particularly with regard to how lifetimes are expected to be universally applicable within the scope of a function or type definition.
