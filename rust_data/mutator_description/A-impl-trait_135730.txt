Mutation Operator: Modify Impl Trait Return Types in Functions

This mutation operator targets function signatures, specifically those that use `impl Trait` in their return type. It applies to any function definition that has a return type using `impl Trait` with nested trait bounds. The operation involves modifying the nested traits or altering the return type to introduce a potential inconsistency or bug, similar to the issue reported.

Step-by-step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions with a signature that returns an `impl Trait`. Specifically, focus on cases where the `impl Trait` includes nested trait bounds (e.g., `impl Future<Output = impl Send>`).

2. Modify the nested trait within the `impl Trait` to introduce a contradiction or an unresolved type. For example, if the return type is `impl Trait<Output = impl SomeTrait>`, change it to `impl Trait<Output = T>`, where `T` is an undeclared generic parameter.

3. If the original function had a concrete return value (e.g., `()`), ensure that the new return type does not match the function's return value, forcing the type checker into a contradictory state.

Example Transformation:
Original Function:
```
fn example_function() -> impl Future<Output = impl Send> {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated Function:
```
fn example_function() -> impl Future<Output = T> {
    // function body
}
```
Here `T` is not declared anywhere, leading to a type inconsistency.

This mutation operator leverages the complexity of `impl Trait` with nested traits to expose potential bugs in the type checking and trait unification processes of the Rust compiler. It covers a wide range of possibilities by altering the trait bounds and introduces contradictions that can lead to internal compiler errors or other unexpected behaviors.
