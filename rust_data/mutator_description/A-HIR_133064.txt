Mutation Operator: Modify Thread-Local Static Initializer

Target Code Construct: This mutation targets thread-local static initializers within a struct or impl block.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a thread-local static variable, which is defined using the `thread_local!` macro.
2. Within the initializer of this thread-local static variable, modify the initialization expression to include a closure.
3. Specifically, alter the initialization such that the closure tries to capture a variable from the surrounding context or has an inner closure. Ensure the closure logic is complex enough without introducing undeclared variables.
4. If the initializer already includes a closure, modify the closure's argument list by adding additional parameters, or nesting another closure inside it.

Example:
Original Code:
```
impl<T> Foo<T, { thread_local! { pub static FOO: Foo = Foo {}; } }> {}
```

Mutated Code:
```
impl<T> Foo<T, { thread_local! { pub static FOO: Foo = Foo { |init| { |inner| /* logic */ } }; } }> {}
```

Explanation:
- The mutation modifies the initialization part of the thread-local static `FOO` by nesting an additional closure inside the existing closure.
- This change explores the interaction between closures and thread-local statics, which can stress-test the compiler's handling of higher-level constructs like closures within macros.
- The mutation is specific and leverages existing variables and structures, ensuring it remains within the bounds of the seed program.
