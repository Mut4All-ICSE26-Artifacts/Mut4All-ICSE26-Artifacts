Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method Signature to Include Non-Existent Trait

- Target Code Construct: Trait Method Definition
- Where it Applies: This mutation operator applies to the signature of a method inside a trait definition.
  
Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait method signature in the seed program. For example, find a trait definition that has a method declaration without a body:
   ```rust
   trait ExampleTrait {
       fn method(&mut self, param: <Self as SomeTrait>::Output) -> <Self as SomeTrait>::Output;
   }
   ```

2. Alter the method signature to include a reference to a non-existent trait by changing the existing trait in the method signature to one that is not imported or defined. For instance, replace `SomeTrait` with `UnknownTrait`:
   ```rust
   trait ExampleTrait {
       fn method(&mut self, param: <Self as UnknownTrait>::Output) -> <Self as UnknownTrait>::Output;
   }
   ```

3. Ensure that the rest of the program does not have the new trait (`UnknownTrait`) defined or imported.

Example:
Original:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    fn method(&mut self, param: <Self as KnownTrait>::Output) -> <Self as KnownTrait>::Output;
}
```
Mutated:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait {
    fn method(&mut self, param: <Self as UnknownTrait>::Output) -> <Self as UnknownTrait>::Output;
}
```

By introducing a reference to a non-existent trait, the mutation operator exploits the compiler's handling of type resolution and trait matching, potentially triggering bugs or unexpected behavior related to trait checking, especially in complex trait-bound scenarios.
