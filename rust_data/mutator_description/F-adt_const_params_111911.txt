Based on the provided bug report, it can be inferred that Rust compiler bugs are more likely to be triggered by the misuse of advanced features like const generics with specific parameters such as lifetimes. The mutation operators should focus on modifying code constructs that involve const generics, lifetimes, and their interactions with other advanced types. The following mutation operator is specifically designed to target these constructs:

Mutation Operator: Const Generic Lifetimes in Function Signatures

1. **Target Construct**: This mutation applies to function definitions that use const generics with lifetimes.

2. **Mutation Rule**:
   a. Identify a function that uses const generic parameters in its signature.
   b. Add or modify a const generic parameter to include a lifetime.
   c. Ensure that the lifetime is concrete (e.g., 'static) and is used in the const parameter. 

3. **Mutation Steps**:
   a. Locate a function with a signature: `pub fn bar<const Y: usize>() {}`.
   b. Modify the signature to introduce a const generic parameter with a lifetime: `pub fn bar<const Z: &'static str, const Y: usize>() {}`.

4. **Example of Mutation**:
   - Original:
     ```rust
     pub fn bar<const Y: usize>() {}
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```rust
     pub fn bar<const Z: &'static str, const Y: usize>() {}
     ```

This mutation operator is designed to explore the interactions between const generics and lifetimes, which are areas prone to issues in the Rust compiler. The modification is applicable to any seed program that uses const generics in function definitions, thus providing wide coverage.
