Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Representation and Use in Transmutation

Target Construct: Enums with `repr` attributes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum declaration with `#[repr(packed, align(...))]` attributes.
2. Remove the `align(...)` attribute while keeping `repr(packed)` intact.
3. Insert an additional variant in the enum that includes fields with different sizes (e.g., varying integer types).
4. Use this modified enum as a source or destination in a transmutation context.

Example:
Original Code
```rust
#[repr(packed, align(0x100))]
#[repr(u8)]
enum V0u8 {
    V,
}

is_maybe_transmutable::<V0u8>();
```

Mutated Code
```rust
#[repr(packed)]
#[repr(u8)]
enum V0u8 {
    V,
    VariantWithFields { a: u16, b: u32 }
}

is_maybe_transmutable::<V0u8>();
```

Explanation of Mutation:
- The `align` attribute is removed, which can affect how the compiler handles memory layout assumptions.
- Adding a variant with fields of different sizes increases the complexity of memory layout, which can stress the transmutability checks.
- This mutation primarily targets potential discrepancies in how transmutability is handled for enums with complex memory layouts and changes in representation.
