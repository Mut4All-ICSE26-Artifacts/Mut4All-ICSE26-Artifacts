Mutation Operator

Target: Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule: Modify the trait bound in trait implementations to introduce a mismatch between the expected type and provided implementation. This approach targets trait implementations where type bounds are specified, ensuring the validity of type constraints are challenged.

Steps:
1. Identify a trait implementation block with a specified type bound. Here, a trait `Iterate` with a type bound `Valid` is implemented.
2. Modify the type bound in the implementation to an incompatible or non-existent trait bound. For example, replace `T: Check` with a non-existent or unrelated trait such as `T: NonExistentTrait`.
3. Ensure the modified trait bound is not implemented for the type involved in the implementation, resulting in trait resolution issues.

Example Pseudo-Code:
```rust
trait TraitA {
    type Ty: SomeTrait;
}

trait UnrelatedTrait {}

impl<T> TraitA for T
where
    T: UnrelatedTrait,
{
    type Ty = ();
}
```
In this pseudo-code, the trait `TraitA` expects a type `Ty` with a trait bound `SomeTrait`. The implementation is modified to require `T: UnrelatedTrait`, which is assumed not to meet the `SomeTrait` requirement, triggering a potential inconsistency or error in the compiler due to the type bound mismatch.
