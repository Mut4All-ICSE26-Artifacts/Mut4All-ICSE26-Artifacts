Mutation Operator: Modify Associated Type Bounds in Trait Definitions

Target: Trait Definitions with Associated Types

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition that includes an associated type. In this context, an associated type is a placeholder type that the trait can define for its implementors.
2. Add an associated type bound to the trait definition that requires the associated type to implement a specific trait. This mutation targets the scenario where bounds on associated types might not be handled correctly by the compiler.
3. Ensure that the associated type is used consistently in the required locations within the trait.

Example:
Original Trait Definition:
```rust
pub trait Trait {
    type Item;
    fn process(&self, item: Self::Item);
}
```

Mutated Trait Definition:
```rust
pub trait Trait {
    type Item: Debug; // Modify to add a trait bound to the associated type
    fn process(&self, item: Self::Item);
}
```

In this mutation, the `Item` associated type of the `Trait` is required to implement the `Debug` trait. This can lead to complex interactions depending on the other implementations and use cases in the program, potentially exposing issues in how associated type bounds are handled in the compiler.
