Mutation Operator: Closure within Type Alias

Target: Closure within a type alias using `impl Trait`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias that uses `impl Trait`, associating it with a trait.
2. Inside the function that returns this type alias, replace the closure with a more complex closure. This closure should capture a variable from the surrounding scope to increase the complexity of the type inference/context.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Identify the type alias like `type OpaqueType = impl OpaqueTrait;`.
- Locate the function returning this type alias, such as `fn mk_opaque() -> OpaqueType { || 0 }`.
- Introduce a variable in the function's scope or use an existing one. For example, introduce `let captured_var = 10;`.
- Modify the closure to capture this variable: `fn mk_opaque() -> OpaqueType { || { let _ = captured_var; 0 } }`.

Example Pseudo-Code (before mutation):
```rust
type OpaqueType = impl OpaqueTrait;
fn mk_opaque() -> OpaqueType {
    || 0
}
```

Example Pseudo-Code (after mutation):
```rust
type OpaqueType = impl OpaqueTrait;
fn mk_opaque() -> OpaqueType {
    let captured_var = 10;
    || { let _ = captured_var; 0 }
}
```

This mutation exploits the interaction of type inference with closures capturing variables, potentially leading to more complex type-resolution scenarios and exposing issues in the compiler's handling of such cases.
