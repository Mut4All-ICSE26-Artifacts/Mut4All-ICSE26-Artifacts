Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics in Structs

Target: Struct Definitions with Const Generics

Description: This mutation operator targets Rust structs that utilize const generics. In particular, it modifies the types of the const generics in the struct definition and implementation.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition that uses const generics. For example, a struct `Outer<const A: i64, const B: i64>()`.
2. Modify the type of one or more const generics. Specifically, change the type of a const generic from one integer type to another (e.g., i64 to usize or vice versa).
3. Apply the same modification to any implementation blocks for the struct to maintain consistency.

Example:
Given Structure:
```
struct Example<const X: i64, const Y: i64>();
```

Transformation:
1. Change `const X: i64` to `const X: usize`.
2. Change `const Y: i64` to `const Y: usize`.

After Mutation:
```
struct Example<const X: usize, const Y: usize>();
```

Implementation Block (if any):
```
impl<const X: i64, const Y: i64> Example<X, Y> {
    // Function definitions
}
```

After Mutation:
```
impl<const X: usize, const Y: usize> Example<X, Y> {
    // Function definitions
}
```

Note: This mutation operator is designed to explore potential issues with type mismatches and layout discrepancies, such as those indicated by internal compiler errors involving layout mismatches for results. This approach can effectively increase the likelihood of encountering similar bugs.
