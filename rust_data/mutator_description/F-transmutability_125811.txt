Mutation Operator
Target: Enum definition with a discriminant value.
Applicable Construct: Enums with explicitly assigned discriminant values.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum with explicitly assigned discriminant values. Example:

   ```
   enum Example {
       Variant1 = 1,
       Variant2 = 2,
   }
   ```

2. Modify the discriminant value of one or more variants such that they overlap or become non-sequential. Example:

   ```
   enum Example {
       Variant1 = 1,
       Variant2 = 1, // Overlapping discriminant value
   }
   ```

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the enum definition within the Rust code. Target enums where the discriminant values are explicitly assigned.

- Select a variant whose discriminant value will be modified. It is crucial that the selected value results in either overlap with another variant or creates a non-sequential series of values.

- Replace the discriminant value with another value that causes overlap or disrupts the sequence. Ensure that the value is a valid integer but conflicts with existing values.

- Verify that no other parts of the code assume a unique sequence of enum discriminants, as this mutation specifically tests how the compiler handles overlapping or out-of-order discriminants.

Purpose:
This mutation targets the compiler's ability to handle enums with overlapping or non-sequential discriminant values, potentially leading to misinterpretation or incorrect handling of such enums during compilation. This mutation leverages the idea that improper handling of discriminants can stress-test the compiler's ability to evaluate variant tags correctly, which relates to the issue mentioned in the bug report.
