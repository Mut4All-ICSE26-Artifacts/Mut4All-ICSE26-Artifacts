Mutation Operator

Target: Structs and Unions with Unnamed Fields

Mutation Rule: Modify unnamed fields in structs and unions to trigger potential compiler bugs related to field uniqueness checks.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Identify a struct or union in the seed program with unnamed fields. For example, an unnamed field in a struct might look like `_: u8`.

2. Replace the unnamed field with a named field. Ensure the field type remains the same, but provide a unique name. For example, change `_: u8` to `field1: u8`.

3. If the struct or union contains multiple unnamed fields, repeat the naming process for each unnamed field, ensuring each name is unique within the scope of the struct or union.

Example:

Original Code:
```
struct Example {
    _: i32,
    _: f64,
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Example {
    field1: i32,
    field2: f64,
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to explore how the compiler handles unnamed fields within data structures, potentially revealing bugs in field uniqueness checks or name resolution. By providing names to previously unnamed fields, this mutation may expose inconsistencies or errors in the compiler's handling of such constructs.
