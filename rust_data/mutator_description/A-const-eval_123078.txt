Mutation Operator: Enum with Exotic Discriminant

Target: Enum definitions with explicit discriminants

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum declaration with explicit discriminants.
2. Replace one of the discriminant values with a non-trivial expression or an invalid variant that does not align with typical indexing (e.g., a negative number, a floating point casted to integer, an arithmetic operation resulting in an overflow, etc.).
3. If the original discriminant is a valid integer, mutate it to a value that intentionally causes out-of-bounds indexing or is not representable by the underlying type.
4. Ensure the enum is utilized in a constant context, such as a `const` declaration, to trigger compile-time evaluation.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```rust
#[repr(usize)]
enum MyEnum {
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = 3,
}

const MY_ENUM_CONST: MyEnum = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(2usize) };
```

Mutated:
```rust
#[repr(usize)]
enum MyEnum {
    A = 1,
    B = 2,
    C = (-1isize) as usize, // Using a non-trivial discriminant
}

const MY_ENUM_CONST: MyEnum = unsafe { std::mem::transmute(4usize) }; // Index out of bound
```

This mutation targets the enum's discriminant values, aiming to break assumptions about their validity and representation, potentially triggering layout issues or invalid value conversions in the constant evaluation phase.
