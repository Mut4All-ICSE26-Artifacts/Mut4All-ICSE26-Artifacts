Mutation Operator: Modify Function Parameter Type in Generic Functions

Target: Generic functions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a generic function with a parameter that includes a reference to a slice type (e.g., `&[T]`).
2. Change the parameter type from a reference to a slice type to a boxed slice type (e.g., `Box<[T]>`).

Steps:
- Locate the function signature that includes a slice type within a reference.
- Modify the parameter that is a slice reference from `&[T]` to `Box<[T]>`.
- Ensure the function's body remains unchanged, as this mutation focuses solely on the function signature.

Example Before Mutation:
```
fn example_function<T>(param: &[T])
where
    [T]: Clone,
{
    // Function body
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```
fn example_function<T>(param: Box<[T]>)
where
    [T]: Clone,
{
    // Function body
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to exploit potential issues in the handling of boxed slices vs. references to slices, particularly under MIR optimizations.
