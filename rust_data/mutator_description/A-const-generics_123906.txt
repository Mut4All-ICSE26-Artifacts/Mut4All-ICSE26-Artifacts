Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Function with Incompatible Return Type

Target: Function with Const Generics

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:
1. Identify a function that uses const generics with a return type dependent on the const generic parameter, such as `fn example_fn<const N: usize>() -> [Type; N]`.

2. Modify the return type of the function to a type that is incompatible with the intended const generic value. For instance, change the function signature from `fn example_fn<const N: usize>() -> [u8; N]` to `fn example_fn<const N: usize>() -> u8`.

3. Ensure that the body of the function still attempts to return a value based on the const generic parameter, such as returning an array or slice while the signature expects a single value.

4. Add necessary code inside the function to simulate logic that would normally utilize the const generic parameter in an array or slice context, but ensure it attempts to use the incompatible return type.

Example Pseudo-code:
```rust
fn example_fn<const N: usize>() -> u8 { // Changed return type to `u8`
    let _value = [42; N]; // Still using N in the logic
    loop {
        break; // Ensure the function is still logically coherent
    }
    0 // Return a single value instead of an array
}

fn main() {
    let _result = example_fn(); // Attempt to call the function
}
```

This mutation targets the inconsistency between the function's return type and its internal logic, leveraging const generics in a way that mismatches expected types, which can lead to compiler crashes or internal errors.
