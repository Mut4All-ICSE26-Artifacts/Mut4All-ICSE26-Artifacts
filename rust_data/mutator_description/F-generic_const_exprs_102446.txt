Mutation Operator: Modify Union with Generic Const Expressions

Target Code Construct: Union Definitions with Generic Const Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify union definitions within the Rust code, specifically targeting unions that use generic const expressions within their fields.
2. Focus on a union field that utilizes a generic const expression in its type definition, such as an array with a length defined by a constant expression involving generics.
3. Modify the constant expression by introducing a dependency on an additional const generic parameter in the union definition.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Locate the union definition, such as:
   ```
   union ExampleUnion<T> {
       field: [u8; const { mem::size_of::<T>() }],
   }
   ```
2. Add a new const generic parameter, 'const N: usize', to the union definition:
   ```
   union ExampleUnion<T, const N: usize> {
       field: [u8; N + mem::size_of::<T>()],
   }
   ```
3. Modify the type of the field to incorporate the new const generic parameter 'N' within the constant expression, thus:
   ```
   field: [u8; N + mem::size_of::<T>()],
   ```
4. Ensure that the usage or instantiation of the union reflects the new const generic parameter, for example, in a test function:
   ```
   fn test_union() {
       let _x: ExampleUnion<i32, 4>;
   }
   ```

Rationale: This mutation operator targets the interaction between const generics and union definitions, which is a likely source of compiler issues when generic const expressions are involved. By introducing an additional const parameter and using it in the expression, this mutation increases the complexity of type evaluation, potentially triggering unhandled cases or bugs in the compiler's const evaluation logic.
