Mutation Operator: Incorrect Lifetime Annotation in Struct Definition

Target: This mutation operator targets struct definitions in Rust programs, specifically those that include lifetime annotations.

Mutation Rule:

1. Locate a struct definition that includes lifetime annotations (e.g., `struct MyStruct<'a>`).

2. Replace the correct lifetime annotation with a reserved or incorrect lifetime name, such as `'static`. Example: Change `struct MyStruct<'a>` to `struct MyStruct<'static>`.

3. Ensure that the incorrect lifetime name is used consistently throughout the struct definition to maintain syntactic correctness, even if it is semantically incorrect.

4. If the struct includes references that use the original lifetime, replace these references with the incorrect lifetime. For instance, if a field is defined as `&'a T`, change it to `&'static T`.

Explanation: This mutation operator introduces an incorrect usage of a reserved lifetime name or an undeclared lifetime, which is likely to trigger compiler errors or panics due to improper handling of lifetimes. By deliberately using a reserved or mismatched lifetime, the mutation exploits the Rust compiler's strict lifetime management, potentially revealing bugs in the compiler's handling of lifetimes, especially in scenarios involving complex types and generic constant expressions. The choice of `'static` is significant because it is a reserved lifetime in Rust, often leading to immediate compilation errors if misused.
