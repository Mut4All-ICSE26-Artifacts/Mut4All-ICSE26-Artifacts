Mutation Operator: Modify Function Type in Type Alias

Target: Type Alias Definition
This mutation operator targets type aliases, specifically those that define function types. It aims to alter the function signature within the type alias to trigger potential issues related to function trait bounds and type compatibility.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias that represents a function type. For example, `type Fn = FnOnce() -> u8;`.
2. Modify the function signature within the type alias by adding a parameter or changing the return type. Ensure the new parameter is compatible with existing code constructs or add a compatible new one.
3. Example:
   - Original: `type Fn = FnOnce() -> u8;`
   - Mutated: `type Fn = FnOnce(u32) -> u16;`
4. Update all instances where this type alias is used to match the new function signature. Ensure any parameters used in function calls are of the correct type.
5. Ensure that the mutation follows Rust's syntax and semantics rules, focusing on areas likely to stress the compiler's const evaluation and type inference mechanisms.

By making these changes, the intention is to explore edge cases in the const evaluation of function types, especially when they are part of more complex structures like tuples or structs. This could potentially lead to issues such as unexpected behavior in function matching or type inference by the compiler.
