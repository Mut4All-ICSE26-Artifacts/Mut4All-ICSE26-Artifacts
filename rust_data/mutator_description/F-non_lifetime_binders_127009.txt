Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics in Function Constraints

Target: Function constraints using const generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a `where` clause utilizing const generics, as shown in the example with `for<const C: usize> [(); C]: Copy`.
2. Modify the const generic type specifier. If it uses `usize`, change it to another primitive integer type such as `u8` or `i32`.
3. Adjust the array in the trait bound to ensure it remains valid with the new type. For instance, if changing from `usize` to `u8`, ensure that the array length remains plausible for the type.
4. Confirm that no other parts of the code depend on the original type specification, or adjust those parts accordingly.

Example before mutation:
```
fn example_function()
where
    for<const C: usize> [(); C]: Copy,
{
}
```

Example after mutation:
```
fn example_function()
where
    for<const C: u8> [(); C as usize]: Copy,
{
}
```

By altering the type of the const generic parameter, this mutation operator targets potential issues with handling different integer types within the Rust compiler's const generics implementation.
