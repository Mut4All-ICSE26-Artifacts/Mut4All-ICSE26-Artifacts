Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Trait with Generic Associated Types (GATs) and Implementation Blocks

Mutation Rule:
- Identify a trait that uses a generic associated type with a lifetime constraint and is implemented for a type.
- Modify the lifetime constraints of the associated type in the implementation to introduce a discrepancy between the trait definition and the implementation.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Locate the trait definition with a generic associated type that uses lifetime parameters. For example:
   
   ```
   trait ExampleTrait<'a> {
       type AssociatedType<'b>
       where
           'a: 'b;
   }
   ```

2. Identify the implementation of this trait for a concrete type. For example:

   ```
   impl<'a> ExampleTrait<'a> for SpecificType {
       type AssociatedType<'b> = ConcreteType where 'a: 'b;
   }
   ```

3. Modify the lifetime constraints in the implementation's associated type to introduce an inconsistency. For instance, change the existing constraint `'a: 'b` to a different or invalid constraint such as `'b: 'a`, or remove it altogether. This alteration should aim to disrupt the expected relationship between the lifetimes as defined in the trait.

   ```
   impl<'a> ExampleTrait<'a> for SpecificType {
       type AssociatedType<'b> = ConcreteType where 'b: 'a; // Introduced inconsistency
   }
   ```

The mutation targets the lifetime constraints within a generic associated type in an implementation, creating an inconsistency designed to provoke bugs related to lifetime handling or ICEs in the Rust compiler.
