Mutation Operator: Introduce Complex Generic Const Expressions

Target: Function definitions with constant expressions in array initializations or similar constructs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function where a constant expression is used within an array initialization or similar construct.
   Example snippet:
   ```rust
   let _data = [0u8; { 1 + 4 }];
   ```
   
2. Introduce a generic constant expression that involves a function's lifetime or type parameters. This can be achieved by changing the constant expression to depend on a type-level parameter or a lifetime parameter.

3. Modify the constant expression to use a generic parameter, creating a more complex expression that could potentially trigger compiler issues related to generic constant evaluations.
   Example transformation:
   ```rust
   let _data = [0u8; { N + 4 }];
   ```
   Where `N` is a generic parameter of the function, e.g., `fn foo<const N: usize>()`.

4. Ensure the context is set up so that the complexity of the expression involves type-level or lifetime-level generics that could interact unexpectedly with Rust's type inference system, particularly with const-evaluatable checks.

5. If the original code does not have such parameters, introduce a simple generic parameter to the function and ensure the array initialization or similar construct uses this parameter:
   ```rust
   async fn foo<const M: usize>() {
       let _data = [0u8; { M + 4 }];
       bar().await
   }
   ```

6. Test the modified code to see if it triggers the same or similar internal compiler errors, as these changes can lead to unexpected interactions with the Rust compiler's handling of generic const expressions.

Explanation: This mutation operator focuses on modifying constant expressions within functions to involve generic parameters. This can lead to situations where the Rust compiler's handling of generic constant expressions may be problematic, especially in cases where these expressions interact with lifetimes or other generic types in complex ways, thus having a higher likelihood of triggering bugs in the compiler.
