Mutation Operator

Target: Function Implementation with Const Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function implementation that includes a constant generic parameter in its signature, such as `impl<const STRATEGIES: usize>`.
2. Modify the body of the function to include an arithmetic operation involving the constant generic parameter that has potential for overflow or illogical calculation, but make sure it doesn't immediately cause a runtime panic by itself. This interplay will challenge the compiler's constant evaluation logic.
3. Ensure the operation results in a significant change in the generic parameter's application context. For example, change the return type to reflect a highly dependent expression on the constant.
4. For instance, if the original function returns a `Combination<{ STRATEGIES + 1 }>` change it to `Combination<{ STRATEGIES * 2 + 1 }>`.

Example:
Original:
```rust
impl<const STRATEGIES: usize> Combination<STRATEGIES> {
    fn add<M>(self) -> Combination<{ STRATEGIES + 1 }> {
        Combination
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl<const STRATEGIES: usize> Combination<STRATEGIES> {
    fn add<M>(self) -> Combination<{ STRATEGIES * 2 + 1 }> {
        Combination
    }
}
```

This mutation challenges the compiler to evaluate a more complex const generic expression during type checking and can potentially reveal bugs related to const evaluation logic.
