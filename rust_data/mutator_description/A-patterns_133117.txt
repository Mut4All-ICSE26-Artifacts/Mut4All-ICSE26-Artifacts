Mutation Operator: Duplicate Match Arms with Identical Conditions

Target Construct:
This mutation operator targets the match expression in Rust, specifically within any function that contains a match statement.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a match expression in the Rust code.
2. Within the match expression, locate a match arm that is already defined with a condition or pattern.
3. Create a new match arm that duplicates the condition or pattern of an existing match arm. Ensure the guard condition (if any) is also duplicated.
4. Maintain the same expression or block of code for the duplicated match arm.

Example of Mutation:

Original:
```rust
fn example() {
    match some_variable {
        PatternA if condition => { /* block A */ }
        PatternB => { /* block B */ }
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn example() {
    match some_variable {
        PatternA if condition => { /* block A */ }
        PatternA if condition => { /* block A */ } // Duplicated match arm
        PatternB => { /* block B */ }
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation specifically duplicates match arms with identical conditions, which may lead to compiler confusion or crashes due to unexpected logical duplication in match evaluation paths.
- The duplication of match arms is intended to exploit potential weaknesses in the handling of match expressions, especially when guards are involved, aiming to trigger or expose hidden compiler bugs.
