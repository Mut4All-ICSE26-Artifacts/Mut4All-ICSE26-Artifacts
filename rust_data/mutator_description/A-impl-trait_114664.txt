Mutation Operator: Modify Function Return Type with Complex Trait Bounds

Target: Function with a return type using `impl Trait`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function in the seed program that returns an `impl Trait`.
2. Replace the single trait bound in the return type with a more complex trait bound using multiple trait bounds combined with the `+` operator.
3. Ensure that the new trait bounds are relevant and can be satisfied by the existing or modified function logic.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Identify a function definition with syntax similar to: `fn function_name() -> impl Trait`.
- Change the return type from `impl Trait` to `impl Trait1 + Trait2`.
- Example mutation on seed code: Change `fn example() -> impl Display` to `fn example() -> impl Display + Debug`.

Example in Pseudo-Code:
Original:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl TraitA {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl TraitA + TraitB {
    // function body with necessary adjustments to satisfy TraitB
}
```

Notes:
- Prefer using traits already implemented by the types used in the function to ensure the mutated code compiles.
- If required, introduce minimal logic inside the function to satisfy newly added trait bounds. Ensure any new logic does not introduce undefined variables or types.
