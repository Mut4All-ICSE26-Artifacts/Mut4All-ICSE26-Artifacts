Mutation Operator: Enum Variant Addition

Target Construct: Enum

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify an existing enum type in the Rust program. This can be a top-level enum or one nested within a struct or another enum.

2. Add a new variant to the identified enum. This variant should be structured to potentially interact with existing ones. Ensure that the naming and type of the new variant are consistent with others in the same enum to maintain compilation viability, yet sufficiently different to trigger possible edge-case handling by the compiler.

3. If the enum is used with the `TransmuteFrom` trait or similar operations, consider adding a variant with a different size or type than existing ones to increase the likelihood of triggering size or alignment-related bugs.

Example:

Original Enum:
```
enum Error {
    Api { b: bool },
    Ethereum,
    Tokio { source: TokioError },
}
```

Mutated Enum:
```
enum Error {
    Api { b: bool },
    Ethereum,
    Tokio { source: TokioError },
    NewVariant { id: u32 }, // Added variant
}
```

Explanation:

By adding a new variant `NewVariant { id: u32 }`, we introduce changes in the memory layout and potential interaction scenarios that could trigger compiler bugs related to size calculations or transmutability checks. This variant is deliberately chosen to be structurally different enough from existing ones (e.g., a simple integer vs. a struct or boolean) to increase the chance of uncovering issues in the compiler's handling of enums, particularly in conjunction with unsafe operations or trait implementations like `TransmuteFrom`.
