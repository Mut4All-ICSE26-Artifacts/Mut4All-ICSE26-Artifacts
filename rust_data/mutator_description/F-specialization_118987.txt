Mutation Operator: Modify Trait and Implementation Constraints

This mutation operator targets traits and their implementations. It focuses on altering the constraints applied to trait implementations, specifically those involving bounds and associated types, as these are areas typically involved in specialization issues.

1. Identify a trait with associated types and implementations having bounds or constraints. In this case, we focus on `trait Assoc` with `type Output`.

2. Mutation Rule:
   - Locate a `default impl` of the trait. For instance, `default impl<T: Clone> Assoc for T`.
   - Alter the type bound in the `default impl` to a different trait or remove it entirely. For example, change `T: Clone` to `T: Copy` or `T` without a bound.
   - Ensure the trait's associated type's implementation is altered as well. If the current implementation is `type Output = bool;`, change it to another type, such as `type Output = u32;`.

Example:

Original Code:
```
default impl<T: Clone> Assoc for T {
    type Output = bool;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
default impl<T> Assoc for T {
    type Output = u32;
}
```

3. Consider the downstream effects on other implementations and ensure they do not conflict with the modified constraints. If there are specific implementations like `impl Assoc for u8 {}`, ensure their associated type remains consistent with the mutation.

4. Apply this mutation to any other instances where traits have default implementations with constraints, prioritizing those with direct associated type usage or generic bounds.

This mutation can help uncover issues related to specialization and how the Rust compiler handles trait constraints and associated types, potentially leading to crashes or incorrect behavior that can expose bugs in trait resolution and specialization processes.
