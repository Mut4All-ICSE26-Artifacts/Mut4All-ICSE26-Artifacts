Mutation Operator:

Target: Function with Const Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function definition that employs const generics.
2. Identify a const parameter in the function signature, such as `for<const C: usize> [(); C]: 'a`.
3. Modify the const parameter constraint from an array type to a more complex expression, such as a tuple or a nested type. This should involve using the existing variable or type where possible. If necessary, declare additional variables or types explicitly.
4. Ensure that these modifications still align with the functionâ€™s logic and constraints in the seed program.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn example_function<const C: usize>(param: [(); C]) {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn example_function<const C: usize>(param: (usize, [(); C])) {
    // Function body
}
```

Instructions:
- Start by identifying a function that uses const generics.
- Modify the const generic constraint from a straightforward array type to a tuple involving the array, incorporating existing types or variables if possible.
- This alteration can complicate the generic constraints and potentially reveal issues in the compiler related to handling of const generics.
