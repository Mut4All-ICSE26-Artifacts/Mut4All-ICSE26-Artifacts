Mutation Operator: Modify Type Alias with Non-Implementing Type

Target: Type Alias with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias in the seed program that uses `impl Trait`, such as `type Foo = impl Trait;`.
2. Locate a place in the code where this type alias is used, preferably where a static or constant variable is assigned to it.
3. Change the value assigned to this type alias to a type that does not implement the required trait. Ensure the new type does not belong to the set of types that implicitly satisfy the trait bounds.
4. If no such variable assignment exists, create a new static assignment using the problematic type.

Example:
Given the original code:
```
type Foo = impl Debug;
static FOO1: Foo = 22_u32;
```

Mutation:
```
type Foo = impl Debug;
static FOO1: Foo = "string"; // Strings do not implement Debug by default
```

This mutation could cause the compilation to fail or trigger unexpected behavior, as it introduces a type incompatibility that the compiler must resolve, potentially exposing type-checking bugs related to `impl Trait`.
