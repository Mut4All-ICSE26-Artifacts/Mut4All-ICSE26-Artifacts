Mutation Operator: Modify Default Const Generics in Struct

Target: Struct Definitions with Const Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition that uses const generics with a default value. For example:
   - `struct S<const N: usize = DEFAULT>`.
   
2. Change the default value of the const generic to an expression that involves non-static or non-constant context, causing ambiguity for the compiler. This means using expressions or variables outside of simple constants. For example, change the default value from `DEFAULT` to an expression like `some_calculated_value` where `some_calculated_value` is not a constant but a function return value or a complex calculation.

3. Ensure that the expression used for mutation is not a constant and relies on runtime values or calculations. This forces the compiler to evaluate something that might not be determined until runtime, which could lead to ICE or other errors.

Example:
Original Struct:
```rust
const DEFAULT: u32 = 10;

struct Example<const N: usize = DEFAULT> {
    value: [u8; N],
}
```

Mutated Struct:
```rust
fn calculate_value() -> usize {
    20
}

struct Example<const N: usize = calculate_value()> {
    value: [u8; N],
}
```

By applying this mutation, the aim is to challenge the compiler's handling of const generics with non-static defaults, which can potentially expose bugs related to const evaluation in generic contexts.
