Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation for Const Context

Target: Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the Rust program that uses the `impl` keyword. This can be for any trait, not limited to `Drop`.
2. Modify the trait implementation to be a const trait implementation by adding the `const` keyword before the trait name.
3. Ensure that the trait is not marked with `#[const_trait]` in the codebase, as this will trigger the error that the trait is not compatible with a const trait implementation.
4. In the case where the trait is already marked with `#[const_trait]`, remove the attribute and proceed with the mutation.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct X;

impl SomeTrait for X {
    fn some_method(&self) {
        // method body
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct X;

impl const SomeTrait for X {
    fn some_method(&self) {
        // method body
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation leverages the pattern observed in the bug report where a const trait implementation was attempted on a trait not marked with `#[const_trait]`. By applying this mutation, we can test the robustness of the compiler's handling of const trait implementations, potentially exposing similar issues as those seen in the bug report. This mutation can be attempted on various existing traits in a codebase, thereby ensuring broad applicability and coverage.
