Mutation Operator

Target: Function Signature

Mutation Rule: Modify the constraints in the `where` clause involving trait bounds and lifetime parameters. Specifically, aim to alter the trait bounds for function types or closure traits to create scenarios that the compiler may not handle correctly.

Instructions:

1. Identify a function with a `where` clause that contains complex trait bounds or lifetime parameters.

2. Modify the trait bound of a function type or closure trait. If a function type is bounded by `FnOnce` or similar traits, change it to another function trait like `Fn` or `FnMut`. This is done to see how the compiler handles different levels of function trait restrictions.

3. If the original function has a lifetime parameter in its trait bound, either introduce a new complex lifetime relation or remove it entirely to see how the compiler deals with incorrect or missing lifetime bounds.

Pseudo-code Example:

Original Code:
```
async fn process<F>(task: F)
where
    for<'a> <i32 as FnOnce<(&'a str,)>>::Output: Future<Output = ()> + 'a,
```

Mutated Code:
```
async fn process<F>(task: F)
where
    for<'b> <i32 as Fn<(&'b str,)>>::Output: Future<Output = ()> + 'b,
```

Note: In this mutation, the `FnOnce` trait is changed to `Fn`, and the lifetime parameter is also adjusted from `'a` to `'b`. This type of mutation can often reveal issues in the compiler's handling of trait bounds and lifetime relationships.
