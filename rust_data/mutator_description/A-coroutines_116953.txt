Mutation Operator:
Target: Function attributes and panic behavior

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions with the `#[no_mangle]` attribute.
2. Insert or modify the panic behavior by adding `#[cfg_attr(target_os = "linux", panic = "unwind")]` above the function declaration.
3. Ensure the panic behavior is set to "unwind" specific to a target operating system.

Example:
Original code:
```rust
#[no_mangle]
fn example_function() {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutated code:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(target_os = "linux", panic = "unwind")]
#[no_mangle]
fn example_function() {
    // Function body
}
```

This mutation is designed to explore how different panic behaviors interact with the `#[no_mangle]` attribute, potentially uncovering issues related to monomorphization and target-specific configurations.
