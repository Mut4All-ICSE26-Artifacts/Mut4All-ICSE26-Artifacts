Mutation Operator

Target: Local variable bindings using `impl Trait` in function bodies

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that contains a local variable binding using the `impl Trait` feature.
2. Change the type of the local variable binding from `&impl Trait` to `impl Trait`.
3. Ensure the value assigned to the binding is compatible with the new type. If necessary, modify the assignment accordingly.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn some_function() {
    let a: i32 = 10;
    let b: &impl PartialEq = &a;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn some_function() {
    let a: i32 = 10;
    let b: impl PartialEq = a;
}
```

Note:
- This mutation operator targets the specific scenario where `impl Trait` is used in local variable bindings within function bodies.
- By changing the reference type `&impl Trait` to `impl Trait`, it tests how the compiler handles direct use of `impl Trait` without a reference, which may expose issues in the type inference or trait implementation.
