Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds in Generic Implementations

Target Construct: Trait bounds in generic struct or enum implementations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a generic struct or enum that has an implementation block with trait bounds. For example, in the provided code, the struct `Repeated<T>` has an implementation for `Deserialize` with a trait bound on `T: DeserializeOwned`.

2. Modify the trait bound in the implementation block by adding an additional trait constraint or changing the existing one. For example, if the current bound is `T: DeserializeOwned`, you could modify it to `T: DeserializeOwned + Clone`.

3. Ensure that any additional trait bounds you introduce are valid in the context of the seed program, meaning that the types or traits involved in the bounds should either exist within the seed program or be standard traits provided by the Rust standard library.

4. If adding an additional constraint such as `Clone`, ensure that the operations within the implementation block that use the constrained type `T` can handle the new trait bound.

Example:
Original Implementation:
```rust
impl<'de, T> Deserialize<'de> for Repeated<T>
where
  T: DeserializeOwned,
{
  // Implementation details...
}
```

Mutated Implementation:
```rust
impl<'de, T> Deserialize<'de> for Repeated<T>
where
  T: DeserializeOwned + Clone,
{
  // Implementation details...
}
```

By modifying the trait bounds in this way, you can test how the Rust compiler handles additional constraints in generic implementations, which is a common area where bugs can occur, especially in complex trait hierarchies.
