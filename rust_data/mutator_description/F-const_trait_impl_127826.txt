Mutation Operator 1

Target Code Construct: Trait Implementation

Application Context: Applies to any implementation of a trait for a type that is missing required functions or methods.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing trait with at least one method defined, e.g., `trait ExampleTrait { fn example_method(&self); }`.
2. Ensure there is an implementation block for this trait in your program, e.g., `impl ExampleTrait for SomeType {}`.
3. Introduce a mutation by omitting the implementation of one or more methods defined in the trait within the implementation block.
   - Original: 
     ```
     impl ExampleTrait for SomeType {
         fn example_method(&self) {
             // Method body
         }
     }
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```
     impl ExampleTrait for SomeType {}
     ```
4. Ensure that there is a reference or call to the omitted method within your program, e.g., `let instance = SomeType; instance.example_method();`.

Expected Effect: The mutation should lead to a compilation error indicating that the implementation of the trait is missing required methods, potentially causing the compiler to crash or produce an internal compiler error (ICE) due to incomplete trait implementation handling.
