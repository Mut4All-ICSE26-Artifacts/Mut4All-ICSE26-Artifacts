Mutation Operator: Introduce Trait Implementation with async Trait Method in a Struct

Target Code Construct: Structs implementing traits with async methods.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait with an async method signature in the seed program.
2. Introduce a new struct in the seed program.
3. Implement the identified trait for the new struct.
4. Provide a body for the async method in the trait implementation.

Steps:

- Find a trait definition in your seed program with an async method signature. For example:

  ```rust
  trait ExampleTrait {
      async fn example_method();
  }
  ```

- Introduce a new struct. If no suitable struct exists, declare a new one:

  ```rust
  struct ExampleStruct;
  ```

- Implement the trait for the struct. Use the existing async method from the trait and provide a dummy body:

  ```rust
  impl ExampleTrait for ExampleStruct {
      async fn example_method() {
          // Provide a simple async block
          async {
              // Perform some trivial operations
              let _result = async { 42 }.await;
          }
          .await;
      }
  }
  ```

- Ensure that the introduced struct and the implemented method make use of existing variables or types if available, or introduce minimal necessary declarations.

- Compile the program using the Rust compiler with the appropriate feature flags enabled, such as `#![feature(async_fn_in_trait)]`.

The mutation's goal is to test if implementing traits with async methods in structs triggers any edge cases in the compiler's handling of async functions within traits, potentially exposing bugs similar to the reported ICE in the provided bug report.
