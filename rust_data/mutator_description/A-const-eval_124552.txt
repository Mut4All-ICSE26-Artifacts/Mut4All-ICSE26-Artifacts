Mutation Operator: Struct Field Type Change

Target: Struct definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct within the code. For this example, consider a struct with multiple fields, such as:

   ```
   struct Example {
       field1: Type1,
       field2: Type2,
   }
   ```

2. Select a field within the struct to change its type. The chosen field should not depend on any specific external or complex type declarations to avoid unnecessary dependencies.

3. Change the type of the selected field to another existing type within the program. If there is no alternative type available, create a simple primitive type change. For instance, if `field1` is of type `Type1`, and `Type2` exists elsewhere, modify it as:

   ```
   struct Example {
       field1: Type2, // Changed from Type1 to Type2
       field2: Type2,
   }
   ```

4. Ensure that the modified field type remains consistent throughout the program. If the field is initialized or accessed elsewhere, change its related code to match the newly assigned type.

5. If the program originally utilized the field involving operations specific to the original type, adapt these operations to the capabilities of the new type where possible.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
struct Data {
    count: u32,
    label: char,
}

fn process(data: Data) {
    // some operations
}
```

After Mutation:
```
struct Data {
    count: char, // Type of 'count' changed from u32 to char
    label: char,
}

fn process(data: Data) {
    // Ensure any operations on 'count' are compatible with type char
}
```

This mutation aims to exploit potential type mismatches or inadequacies in handling different types within the Rust compiler, potentially triggering compiler bugs related to type checking or conversion.
