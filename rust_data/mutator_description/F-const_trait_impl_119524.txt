Mutation Operator: Function Signature Trait Bounds

Target: Function parameter trait bounds within function signatures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program with parameters that have trait bounds, e.g., `fn example<T: Trait>()`.
2. Modify the trait bounds of the parameters by introducing an unsupported or misplaced trait bound, specifically using `~const` in contexts where it is not valid.
3. Ensure that the function is a `const fn` if not already, which is a typical context where const trait bounds might be misused.
4. Example:

Before Mutation:
```
fn process_value<T: Display>(value: T) {
    println!("{}", value);
}
```

After Mutation:
```
const fn process_value<T: ~const Display>(value: T) {
    println!("{}", value);
}
```

Explanation: This mutation targets the function's parameter trait bounds by introducing `~const`, which is not allowed in trait objects. This operation is designed to trigger errors related to trait bound misplacement, potentially causing the compiler to crash or produce incorrect behavior in analyzing const contexts.
