Mutation Operator 1: Modify Trait Bound with Const Generics

Target: The mutation operator targets trait declarations with associated type constraints and const generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that contains an associated type with a bound that utilizes const generics. For example, a trait similar to `trait A { type T: B<U<1i32> = ()>; }`.
2. Modify the const value used in the generic parameters of the associated type's bound. If the original const value is `1i32`, change it to another integer value such as `0i32` or `2i32`.
3. Ensure that the modified const value is one that could potentially cause a logic change or an overflow, e.g., using negative numbers or boundary values like `i32::MAX`.
4. If other constants or types are available in the seed program, use them to replace the original const value in the bound.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait A {
    type T: B<U<1i32> = ()>;
}
```
Mutated Code:
```rust
trait A {
    type T: B<U<0i32> = ()>;
}
```

Explanation: This mutation operator specifically alters the const generic parameter within trait bounds, which can affect the behavior of the bound and potentially induce issues in how the compiler handles const generics and associated types. This kind of mutation can lead to unexpected compiler crashes or inconsistencies if the compiler does not handle the new const generic value properly.
