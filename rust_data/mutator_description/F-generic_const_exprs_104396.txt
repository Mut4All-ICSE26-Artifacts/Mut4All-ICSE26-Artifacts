Mutation Operator: Inline Attribute Manipulation

Target Code Construct:
Function definitions with the `#[inline(always)]` attribute.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that has the `#[inline(always)]` attribute.
2. Remove the `#[inline(always)]` attribute from the function.
3. Optionally, replace it with `#[inline]` or remove the inline attribute entirely.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
#[inline(always)]
fn compute<const N: usize>(value: usize) -> [usize; N] {
    let mut result = [0; N];
    for i in 0..N {
        result[i] = value + i;
    }
    result
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn compute<const N: usize>(value: usize) -> [usize; N] {
    let mut result = [0; N];
    for i in 0..N {
        result[i] = value + i;
    }
    result
}
```

This mutation aims to reveal issues related to the compiler's handling of inline attributes, particularly in combination with other features like generic constant expressions. Removing the inline attribute may affect optimization and is likely to uncover compiler bugs related to code generation and inlining decisions.
