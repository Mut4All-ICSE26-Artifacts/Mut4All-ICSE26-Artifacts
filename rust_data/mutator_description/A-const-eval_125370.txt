Mutation Operator: Modify Loop in Const Context

Target: This operator targets `const` functions or constants that involve loops within their bodies.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `const` function or constant where a loop is used, such as `const fn` or `const` definitions.
2. Transform the loop to include a break condition that utilizes an undefined or ambiguous type. This aims to misuse or confuse type inference and resolution during constant evaluation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Start with a loop in a `const` function or constant, for example:
  ```
  const fn my_const_fn() -> MyType {
      const VALUE: MyType = loop {
          // Original loop content
      };
  }
  ```
- Introduce a break condition with an ambiguous or undeclared type:
  ```
  const fn my_const_fn() -> MyType {
      const VALUE: MyType = loop {
          if condition_with_undeclared_type() {
              break;
          }
          // Original loop content
      };
  }
  ```
- Ensure that `condition_with_undeclared_type()` either refers to a non-existent type or introduces type ambiguity, such as calling a function or method with mismatched types.

Example (Pseudo-code):
- Original:
  ```
  const fn example() -> i32 {
      const VALUE: i32 = loop {
          // infinite loop
      };
  }
  ```
- Mutated:
  ```
  const fn example() -> i32 {
      const VALUE: i32 = loop {
          if let SomeUndefinedType = some_undefined_var {
              break;
          }
          // original loop content
      };
  }
  ```

Note: This mutation leverages the compiler's handling of types within constant evaluation, potentially leading to errors related to type inference, resolution, and ICEs if not properly handled. The mutation targets the introduction of type mismatches or references to undeclared types in constant contexts.
