Mutation Operator
Target: Function Definitions using the "extern" keyword with "rust-call" ABI.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions that use the "extern" keyword with the "rust-call" ABI, such as `extern "rust-call" fn`.
2. Alter the ABI from "rust-call" to "C" for the target function.
3. Ensure that the signature of the function remains unchanged, only the ABI is changed to "C".

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
extern "rust-call" fn example_function(&self) -> Option<Arc<T>> {}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
extern "C" fn example_function(&self) -> Option<Arc<T>> {}
```

This operator aims to modify the ABI of functions to potentially expose inconsistencies or bugs related to function calling conventions, especially in cases where specific ABIs like "rust-call" are used. This mutation can lead to the manifestation of compiler errors or crashes in scenarios where the function calling convention plays a crucial role in the program's execution.
