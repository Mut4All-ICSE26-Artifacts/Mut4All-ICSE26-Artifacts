Mutation Operator:
Target: Constant Declaration
Description: Modify the declaration of a constant to include an explicit type signature, especially with structures that involve arrays or collections. This mutation operator aims to create scenarios where the Rust compiler may struggle with type inference, which could potentially lead to internal errors.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a constant declaration in the seed program that lacks an explicit type signature. For example, `const SOME_CONST = [];`.
2. Modify the declaration by adding an explicit, yet incorrect, type signature. This could involve specifying a type that is incompatible with the content or structure of the constant.
3. Ensure that the modified type signature is syntactically correct to prevent early syntax errors, but semantically incorrect to provoke deeper compiler analysis.

Example:
Original:
```
const EMPTY_ARRAY = [];
```

Mutated:
```
const EMPTY_ARRAY: [i32; 0] = [];
```

In this example, even though the array is empty, an explicit type signature is added to challenge the compilerâ€™s type inference and potentially trigger issues related to type handling.
