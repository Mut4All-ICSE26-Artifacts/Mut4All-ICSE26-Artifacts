Based on the Rust compiler bug information, it appears that an index out of bounds error is encountered, particularly in relation to the borrow checker and async functions. The bug involves misuse of lifetime annotations and async functions, likely causing an internal compiler error (ICE).

Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Definitions, especially async functions with lifetimes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an async function with multiple lifetime parameters in its signature.
2. Modify the function signature to use a single lifetime parameter multiple times instead of distinct ones. 
3. Ensure the function signature includes parameters that would typically require separate lifetime annotations.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Let's assume you have an async function with the signature:
  async fn example_function<'a, 'b>(param1: &'a str, param2: &'b str) -> &'a str { ... }

- Change it to use a single lifetime parameter:
  async fn example_function<'a>(param1: &'a str, param2: &'a str) -> &'a str { ... }

This mutation targets potential inconsistencies or assumptions made by the borrow checker about lifetime relationships, aiming to uncover similar bugs or misbehaviors within the compiler related to lifetime handling.
