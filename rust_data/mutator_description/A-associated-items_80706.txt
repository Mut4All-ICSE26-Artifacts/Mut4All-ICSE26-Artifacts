Mutation Operator:

Target: Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation block for a specific struct. In the provided seed code, this would be something like `impl Storage for InMemoryStorage`.
2. Modify the type of an associated type of a trait implementation for a struct, such that it becomes incompatible or undefined within the context of the trait's required interface. 
3. In the trait `Storage`, change the associated `Error` type for `InMemoryStorage` to a new, undeclared type.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
impl Storage for InMemoryStorage {
    type Error = String;
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
impl Storage for InMemoryStorage {
    type Error = UndefinedType; // UndefinedType is not declared
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces an undefined type which the Rust compiler will attempt to resolve during type checking and monomorphization processes. By altering the associated type to one that is not defined within the context of the current program, you can explore how the compiler handles resolution errors related to associated types. This kind of mutation specifically targets the compiler's handling of trait-associated types, which is relevant given the presence of the `A-associated-items` label in the bug report.
