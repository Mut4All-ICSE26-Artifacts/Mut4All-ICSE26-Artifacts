Mutation Operator: Modify Struct and Union Alignments

Applicable Code Construct: Unions and Structs with Explicit Alignment Modifiers

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify all structs and unions in the code that have explicit alignment attributes, specifically those using `#[repr(packed)]`, `#[repr(C)]`, or analogous attributes affecting memory alignment.

2. For a selected struct or union, remove the `#[repr(packed)]` attribute if present. This mutation targets the adjustment of how data types are aligned in memory, potentially triggering issues related to alignment expectations and ABI compliance.

3. If the `#[repr(packed)]` attribute is removed, ensure the struct or union is still valid without this attribute by recompiling and running tests. If removing `#[repr(packed)]` results in compiler errors or warnings related to alignment, record these results for further analysis.

Example Pseudo-Code Before Mutation:
```rust
#[repr(packed)]
struct PackedStruct {
    field1: u8,
    field2: u32,
}

union ExampleUnion {
    int_val: u32,
    packed_struct: PackedStruct,
}
```

Example Pseudo-Code After Mutation:
```rust
struct PackedStruct {
    field1: u8,
    field2: u32,
}

union ExampleUnion {
    int_val: u32,
    packed_struct: PackedStruct,
}
```

Reasoning: This mutation is likely to expose bugs related to assumptions about data alignment and memory layout, as removing packing attributes changes how the compiler arranges data in memory, potentially triggering internal compiler errors (ICE) like the one described in the bug report. By focusing on attributes that affect data layout, this mutation operator can effectively reveal inconsistencies and misalignments that might otherwise go unnoticed.
