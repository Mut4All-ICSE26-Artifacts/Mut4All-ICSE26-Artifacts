Mutation Operator: Closure Parameter Variance

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets functions with a signature involving lifetimes and closures or coroutine-like structures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that has a lifetime parameter associated with its argument or return type.
2. Select a function parameter that is a reference type or involves a lifetime. If no such parameter exists, add a new one while ensuring it uses an existing lifetime parameter from the function's signature.
3. Replace the selected parameter with a closure that captures the lifetime variable. Ensure that the closure has an internal variable with a reference to the original parameter type.
4. Update the function body to use the closure, ensuring that any use of the original parameter is replaced with a closure call.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
fn process_data<'a>(input: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    input
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
fn process_data<'a>(closure_input: impl FnOnce() -> &'a str) -> &'a str {
    let intermediate = closure_input();
    intermediate
}
```

Explanation:
1. The original function `process_data` takes a reference to a string slice with lifetime `'a`.
2. The parameter `input` is replaced with a closure `closure_input` which captures and returns a value with the same lifetime `'a`.
3. Inside the function body, the use of `input` is replaced with a call to `closure_input`. The return type remains unchanged to preserve the associated lifetime.

This mutation operator exploits the variance constraints of Rust's lifetime system by introducing a closure that captures a lifetime, potentially triggering issues related to variance computation, as seen in the bug report.
