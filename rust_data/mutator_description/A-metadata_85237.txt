Mutation Operator: Modify Function Return Type with Generics

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets function definitions, specifically the return type part of a function that deals with iterator types and involves generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that returns an iterator with a specified `Item` type.
2. Modify the return type of this function by changing or removing the generic `Item` type parameter from the iterator type.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a function with a return type that includes `std::slice::Iter` or `std::slice::IterMut` and has a specified `Item` type.
- For a function like `pub fn iter(&self) -> std::slice::Iter<Item = T>`, modify it to `pub fn iter(&self) -> std::slice::Iter`.
- Ensure that the rest of the code relies on the structure of the collection being iterated over, rather than explicit type annotations for the iterator.
- Verify that no additional type constraints are violated due to the removal or alteration of the generic type item.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
impl PieceShape {
    pub fn iter(&self) -> std::slice::Iter<Item = (isize, isize)> {
        self.0.iter()
    }
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
impl PieceShape {
    pub fn iter(&self) -> std::slice::Iter {
        self.0.iter()
    }
}
```

Rationale:
The mutation modifies the generics in the return type of iterator functions, which can lead to internal compiler inconsistencies or ICEs if the compiler's handling of associated items or metadata is flawed. This is especially related to how the Rust compiler deals with generic types and their constraints in iterator contexts.
