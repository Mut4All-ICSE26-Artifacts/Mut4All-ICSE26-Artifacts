Mutation Operator: Modifying ADT Constant Parameters in Struct Implementations

Target: Structs with associated constant functions.

Application: This mutation operator targets associated constant functions within struct implementations that are used to define ADT constant parameters.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify structs that implement traits with custom const functions, especially those using `#![feature(adt_const_params)]`.

2. Locate constant functions within these structs that return references or pointers, often using unsafe code (`std::mem::transmute`).

3. Modify the return type of the const function to a different reference type. If it currently returns `&'static MyStr`, change it to `&'static str`.

4. Adjust the body of the const function to match the new return type, ensuring that the function logic remains semantically meaningful but causes potential mismatches with the calling code.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
impl MyStr {
    const fn new(s: &'static str) -> &'static MyStr {
        unsafe { std::mem::transmute(s) }
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl MyStr {
    const fn new(s: &'static str) -> &'static str {
        s // Directly return the input string reference
    }
}
```

By modifying the return type, this mutation operator exploits potential inconsistencies in how the Rust compiler handles ADT constant parameters, increasing the likelihood of triggering internal compiler errors or unexpected behaviors.
