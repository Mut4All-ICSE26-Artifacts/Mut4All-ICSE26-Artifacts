Mutation Operator: Modify Static Initialization with Drop

Target Construct: Static variable initialization block

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a static variable initialization block in the Rust code. The identified static must include a data structure that could involve a destructor, such as a vector, string, or a user-defined type with a Drop implementation.
2. Within the static initialization block, declare a local array, vector, or another collection type with elements that have a Drop implementation, such as String or Vec.
3. Directly assign a new instance of the element type to an index in the collection. Ensure that the assignment to the collection is not preceded by initialization of the entire collection. This creates a situation where the compiler needs to handle uninitialized memory for a type that implements Drop.
4. Example:
   
   Original:
   ```
   static T: () = {
       let test_arr: [String; 1];
       test_arr[0] = String::new();
   };
   ```

5. Mutation: 
   ```
   static U: () = {
       let test_vec: Vec<String>;
       test_vec.push(String::from("Example"));
   };
   ```

Explanation:
- This mutation operator targets static initialization blocks, focusing on manipulating collection types involving Drop traits. 
- By adding an element to a vector without properly initializing the vector, the mutation can trigger issues in the handling of destructors during static initialization.
- The changes are designed to exploit compiler weaknesses in managing partially initialized structures with drop semantics, leading to potential ICE (Internal Compiler Error) scenarios.
