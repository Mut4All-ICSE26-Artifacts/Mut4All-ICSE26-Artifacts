Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Incomplete Delegation

Target Code Construct: Trait implementation in combination with function delegation.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation block where a function is being delegated using the syntax `<Type as Trait>::{function}`.
2. Intentionally omit necessary context or signature details in the delegation, which could cause `Option` to become `None` when expected to be `Some`.
3. Ensure that the trait's function is left partially defined or improperly referenced within the trait implementation block.

Example Mutation:
- Original Code:
  ```
  struct MyStruct;

  trait MyTrait {
      fn my_function(&self) -> i32;
  }

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      reuse <i32 as MyTrait>::{my_function} { &const { SomeReference } }
  }
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```
  struct MyStruct;

  trait MyTrait {
      fn my_function(&self) -> i32;
  }

  impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
      reuse <i32 as MyTrait>::{my_function} { &const { } }
  }
  ```

In this mutation, the `SomeReference` is removed, which leads to an incomplete delegation context. This can potentially cause the Rust compiler to encounter an `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value, similar to the issue described in the bug report.
