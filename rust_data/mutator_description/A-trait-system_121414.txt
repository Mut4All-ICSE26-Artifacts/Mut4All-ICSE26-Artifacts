Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule:
- Identify a trait implementation block `impl<'a> TraitName for StructName<'b> {}`.
- Introduce an undeclared lifetime parameter within the implementation that is not declared in the `impl` block's lifetime parameters.
- Specifically, replace a declared lifetime in the struct with a new undeclared lifetime, creating a mismatch.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Locate the implementation block for a trait within the seed program.
   Example: `impl<'a> SomeTrait for SomeStruct<'b> {}`
   
2. Identify the lifetimes declared and used in the implementation.
   
3. Introduce an undeclared lifetime in the struct instantiation inside the impl block.
   - Change: Replace the declared lifetime `'b` in `SomeStruct<'b>` with a new undeclared lifetime, such as `'c`.
   - Result: `impl<'a> SomeTrait for SomeStruct<'c> {}`

4. Ensure that the new lifetime `'c` is not declared in the impl block or any surrounding context.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl<'a> MyTrait for MyStruct<'b> {
    // implementation
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl<'a> MyTrait for MyStruct<'c> {
    // implementation
}
```

Note: This mutation introduces a lifetime mismatch and aims to create scenarios similar to the original bug report, where lifetime parameters are mismatched and potentially cause internal compiler errors during trait resolution.
