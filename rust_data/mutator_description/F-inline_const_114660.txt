Mutation Operator: Modify Constant Block with Intrinsic Function

Target: Constant blocks within functions that use intrinsic functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function in the seed program that contains a constant block using an intrinsic function.
2. Replace the intrinsic function call within the constant block with a different intrinsic function of similar type, ensuring it takes the same input and output types.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
```
fn example() {
    const { core::mem::transmute::<u8, u8> };
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn example() {
    const { core::intrinsics::volatile_load::<u8> };
}
```

Instructions:
- Identify the `const` block within a function.
- Replace the current intrinsic function inside the `const` block (e.g., `core::mem::transmute`) with a different intrinsic function (e.g., `core::intrinsics::volatile_load`).
- Ensure that the new intrinsic function accepts the same type(s) to maintain type correctness within the `const` block.
- Check for intrinsic functions with similar characteristics in terms of input and output types to ensure a valid transformation.
