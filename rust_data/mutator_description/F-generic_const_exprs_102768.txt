Mutation Operator: Modify Associated Type Lifetimes

Target: Apply this mutation operator to functions using associated types with lifetime arguments.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that takes a trait object with an associated type expecting a specific number of lifetime parameters (e.g., `Box<dyn Trait<AssocType<'a, 'b>>>`).
2. Alter the number of lifetime parameters provided to the associated type to trigger a mismatch error.
3. Specifically, if the associated type expects one lifetime, provide zero or more than one. If it expects none, provide one or more.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    type AssocType<'a>;
}

fn example_function<'a>(input: Box<dyn MyTrait<AssocType<'a>>>)
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
// Suppose AssocType expects 1 lifetime parameter, provide 0 instead.
fn example_function<'a>(input: Box<dyn MyTrait<AssocType>>)
```
or
```rust
// Suppose AssocType expects 1 lifetime parameter, provide 2 instead.
fn example_function<'a, 'b>(input: Box<dyn MyTrait<AssocType<'a, 'b>>>)
```

Note: This mutation exploits the expectation of lifetime parameter counts in associated types, leading to type checking errors that could potentially reveal compiler issues when combined with features like `generic_const_exprs`.
