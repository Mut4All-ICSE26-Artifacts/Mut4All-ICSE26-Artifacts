Mutation Operator: Modify Closure Capture in Const Context

Target Code Construct: Closure within a const function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a closure within a const function. Look for the `const fn` keyword followed by a closure defined with `||`.
2. Modify the closureâ€™s capture mechanism by introducing a variable that is defined outside the closure but used within it. For example, add a `let` statement before the closure that declares a variable.
3. Use this variable inside the closure in a way that captures it. The simplest way is to reference it directly within the closure.
4. Ensure that the variable type is compatible with the closure context.

Example:
Original Code Snippet:
```rust
const fn test() -> impl std::mem::BikeshedIntrinsicFrom() {
    || {
        let sl: &[u8] = b"foo";
        match sl {
            [first, remainder @ ..] => assert_eq!(first, &b'f'),
            [] => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

Mutated Code Snippet:
```rust
const fn test() -> impl std::mem::BikeshedIntrinsicFrom() {
    let buffer: &[u8] = b"bar"; // Declare a variable outside the closure
    || {
        let sl: &[u8] = buffer; // Use the variable inside the closure, causing a capture
        match sl {
            [first, remainder @ ..] => assert_eq!(first, &b'b'),
            [] => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

In this mutated version, the closure captures the variable `buffer` from its surrounding context. This modification is designed to trigger compiler behaviors related to closure capture mechanisms, especially in const contexts where closure behaviors are more constrained.
