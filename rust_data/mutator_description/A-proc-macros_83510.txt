Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Object Syntax in Type Alias

Target: Type aliases involving trait objects

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias in the seed program that involves a trait object, such as `type Foo = Box<Bar> + Baz;`.
2. Change the trait object syntax to use the `dyn` keyword explicitly. For example, modify the alias to `type Foo = Box<dyn Bar + Baz>;`.
3. If the type alias includes multiple traits, ensure they are combined correctly after the `dyn` keyword, keeping the same traits as before but explicitly marking them as a single trait object.

Example:
Original:
```rust
type Wrapper = Box<Debug> + Clone;
```

Mutated:
```rust
type Wrapper = Box<dyn Debug + Clone>;
```

This mutation targets the specific issue identified in the bug report, where a trait object syntax might cause the compiler to crash due to improper handling or resolution. By explicitly using `dyn`, we explore the compiler's ability to resolve trait objects correctly. This operator is applicable to any Rust codebase where type aliases involving trait objects are used, providing broad coverage and potential to reveal related issues in trait resolution.
