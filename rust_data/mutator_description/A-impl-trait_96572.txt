Mutation Operator: Modify Type Alias with Impl Trait

Target: Type aliases with `impl Trait`, specifically those that define complex or tuple types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a type alias that is defined using `impl Trait`. For example, `type T = impl Trait;`.
2. If the type alias references a tuple or composite type, such as `type T = impl Copy; let foo: T = (1u32, 2u32);`, modify the tuple to include additional different types that are not constrained by the `impl Trait`. For instance, add a boolean or a reference.
3. Modify the existing type alias to include an additional constraint that is not directly satisfied by the new types. This could involve introducing a trait bound that is not met, or a lifetime that is not covered.
4. Ensure that the new type does not have clear or direct implementations for the trait in question, potentially by using a custom type or primitive that is unrelated to the trait.

Example:
Original Code:
```
type T = impl Copy;
let foo: T = (1u32, 2u32);
```

Mutated Code:
```
type T = impl Copy + SomeNewTrait; // Introduce a new trait constraint
let foo: T = (1u32, 2u32, false); // Add a boolean, which does not implement SomeNewTrait

trait SomeNewTrait {}
// Assume that `u32` and `bool` do not implement `SomeNewTrait`
```

Note: Ensure that `SomeNewTrait` is not implemented for the added types in the mutation. This will test the compiler's ability to manage and infer complex type constraints with `impl Trait`, potentially triggering similar bugs or ice conditions.
