Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Expressions

Target Construct: Trait implementations with const generic parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify trait implementations that use const generics, specifically where a calculation involving these generics is performed within a `where` clause or other constraint expressions.
2. Modify the const expression by introducing an arithmetic operation that results in an overflow. For example, if the expression is `{N - 1}`, change it to `{N + 255}` or `{N * 256}` assuming `N` is a `u8`.
3. Additionally, remove any unnecessary braces to alter the expression formatting, as noted in the warning message.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl<T, const N: u8> MyFn<T> for Bubble<T, N>
where
    [(); {N - 1}]:,
{
    type Output = [T; 1];
    fn call(self, args: T) -> [T; 1] {
        let f = Bubble::<[T; 1], {N - 1}>{t: std::marker::PhantomData};
        f.call([args])
    }
}
```

Mutated Content:
1. Change the constraint to cause overflow:
   ```rust
   [(); N + 255]:
   ```
2. Remove unnecessary braces, although it may not affect the overflow, it follows the suggested code style:
   ```rust
   [(); N + 255]:
   ```

The mutation is aimed at simulating conditions that lead to overflow in const expressions, which can reveal potential compiler bugs in handling such scenarios during type-checking or code generation in Rust.
