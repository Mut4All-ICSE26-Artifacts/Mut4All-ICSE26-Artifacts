Mutation Operator

Target: Static Variable Declaration

Mutation Rule: Modify the type of a static variable from a complex unsized type (like `dyn* Send + Sync`) to a simple unsized type (like `dyn Trait`). This exploits the handling of unsized types and places the compiler in a position where it might not correctly handle the type difference, leading to a potential crash.

Steps:
1. Identify a static variable declaration that uses a complex unsized type, particularly one involving multiple traits or markers (e.g., `dyn* Send + Sync`).
2. Simplify the type by reducing the trait components to a single trait. Ensure that the selected trait is a valid Rust trait that can be used unsized.
3. Retain the `async` block initialization, as it tends to interact with the compiler's const evaluation and async handling, which are prone to bugs.
4. Ensure the rest of the code remains unaffected to isolate the mutation effect.

Example in Natural Language:
- Original: A static variable is declared with a type that combines multiple traits with `dyn*`, like `dyn* Send + Sync`.
- Mutated: Change this type to a single `dyn Trait`, such as `dyn MyTrait`, where `MyTrait` is defined elsewhere in the code.

Purpose: This mutation examines how the Rust compiler manages type complexities and unsized types, which is a common area for potential internal compiler errors, especially when interacting with recent features like `const_async_blocks`.
