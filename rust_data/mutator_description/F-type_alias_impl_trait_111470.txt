Mutation Operator: Modify Type Aliases with Opaque Types

1. Target: This mutation applies to type aliases utilizing the `impl Trait` syntax, especially those involved in generics or higher-order functions.

2. Precise Mutation Rule:
   a. Identify a type alias that uses the `impl Trait` syntax. For example, in the given code, `type ImplT = impl Debug;` is such an alias.
   b. Change the trait used in the `impl Trait` syntax to a different trait or a combination of traits that the original type or function might not fully satisfy. This aims to introduce a mismatch in the expected and actual trait implementations.
   c. Ensure the change is semantically valid (e.g., replacing `Debug` with `Clone` if the type can logically implement clone).

3. Mutation Example:
   - Original:
     ```rust
     type ImplT = impl Debug;
     type FooImpl = Foo<ImplT, impl FnOnce(ImplT)>;
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```rust
     type ImplT = impl Clone; // Changed from Debug to Clone
     type FooImpl = Foo<ImplT, impl FnOnce(ImplT)>;
     ```

4. Explanation:
This mutation targets the mismatch in trait expectations versus actual implementations. By subtly altering trait requirements for opaque types, we introduce opportunities for the compiler to encounter unanticipated unification issues, especially in contexts involving generics and trait bounds. The mutation is broad in its applicability as it doesn't introduce new elements but modifies existing structures to create potential compilation challenges.
