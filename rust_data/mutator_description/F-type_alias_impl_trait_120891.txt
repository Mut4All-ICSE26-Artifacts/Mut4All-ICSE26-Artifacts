Mutation Operator:
Target Construct: Type Alias using `impl Trait`
Mutation Rule: Convert a type alias defined with `impl Trait` into a struct embedding the same trait.

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:
1. Identify a type alias defined with `impl Trait`, such as `type AliasName = impl TraitName;`.
2. Replace the type alias with a struct definition.
3. Define the struct with a single private field and implement the same trait for the struct.

Example Transformation:
Original Code:
```rust
type Bar<T: Foo> = impl std::fmt::Debug;
```

Transformed Code:
```rust
struct Bar<T: Foo> {
    _inner: T, // Private field to emulate the `impl Trait` behavior
}

impl<T: Foo + std::fmt::Debug> std::fmt::Debug for Bar<T> {
    // Implement the trait methods here, possibly forwarding to `_inner`
}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation leverages changing the type alias with `impl Trait` to a struct that encapsulates the type and explicitly implements the trait. This transformation can potentially expose issues with alias normalization and trait coherence, similar to the underlying problem in the bug report.
- Existing traits and constraints are utilized to ensure the structure aligns with the original behavior as much as possible, ensuring universality and broad applicability.
