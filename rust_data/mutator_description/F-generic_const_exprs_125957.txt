Mutation Operator:

Target: Struct and Trait with Generic Const Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct or trait that uses generic const expressions, such as `pub struct Equal<const T: usize, const R: usize>` or a trait with associated const expressions.
2. Add a new associated constant to the struct or trait, which will be defined as a generic const expression involving existing constants or parameters.
3. Ensure that the new constant refers to other constants in a non-trivial way, potentially introducing cyclic dependencies or conflicting constraints.

Example Mutation Steps:
- Given the struct `pub struct Equal<const T: usize, const R: usize>();`, modify it as follows:

Before Mutation:
```rust
pub struct Equal<const T: usize, const R: usize>();
```

After Mutation:
```rust
pub struct Equal<const T: usize, const R: usize>() {
    const DIFF: usize = T - R; // Introduce a new constant based on existing constants T and R
}
```

- For a trait like `pub trait Tokenize` with associated consts, modify it similarly:

Before Mutation:
```rust
pub trait Tokenize<'life, 'borrow, 'compact, 'reborrow> {
    const TO: fn(&Arena<'life>, &'borrow Guard<'compact>, Self) -> Self::Tokenized;
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
pub trait Tokenize<'life, 'borrow, 'compact, 'reborrow> {
    const TO: fn(&Arena<'life>, &'borrow Guard<'compact>, Self) -> Self::Tokenized;
    const SIZE_DIFF: usize = Self::Tokenized::SIZE - Self::Untokenized::SIZE; // Use associated consts in an expression
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to provoke unexpected compiler behavior by introducing new relationships and constraints via generic const expressions, a feature known to have incomplete support in the Rust compiler.
