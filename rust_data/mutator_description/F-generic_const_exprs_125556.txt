Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Parameters to Use Unsupported Types

Target: Struct Definitions with Const Generic Parameters

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a struct in the program with const generic parameters.
2. Identify the const generic parameters currently being used. Ensure that these parameters are either integers, booleans, or characters, as these are the only types currently supported.
3. Modify the type of one of these const generic parameters to a multi-dimensional array type, which is currently unsupported without additional feature flags.
4. Ensure that the array type is explicitly declared within the mutation rather than relying on an undeclared type.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
pub struct Example<const N: usize> {
    data: [u8; N],
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
pub struct Example<const N: [[usize; 3]; 3]> {
    data: [u8; 3],
}
```

Note: The change introduces a multi-dimensional array type as a const generic parameter, which is expected to trigger compilation issues without the required feature flags. This mutation leverages the fact that Rust's const generic system has limitations on the types that can be used.
