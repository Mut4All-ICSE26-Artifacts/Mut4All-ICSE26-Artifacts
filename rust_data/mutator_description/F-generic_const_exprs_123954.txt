Mutation Operator:
This mutation operator targets struct definitions with generic parameters in Rust code. The focus is on modifying the sequence and default values of const generics and type generics in the struct definition.

Precise Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a struct in the seed program that uses both const generics and type generics in its definition. For instance, a struct defined as `struct X<const C: usize, T>`.
Step 2: Modify the order of the const generics and type generics, ensuring that a default value is applied to the const generic. Swap the position of a const generic with a type generic, and provide a default value to the const generic if not yet applied. For example, change `struct X<const C: usize, T>` into `struct X<T, const C: usize = {1 + 1}>`.
Step 3: Ensure that the modified code compiles by checking that any instances of the struct in the seed program are updated to match the new generic ordering, using existing type and const values where possible.
Step 4: Compile the modified seed program to test if the compiler encounters a crash or ICE during the compilation process.

Example Transformation:
Before:
```
struct MyStruct<const N: usize, T> {
    _x: [T; N]
}
```

After:
```
struct MyStruct<T, const N: usize = {3}> {
    _x: [T; N]
}
```

This operator is designed to exploit potential issues in the compiler related to the handling of const generics with default values, especially when their order is altered in relation to type generics.
