Mutation Operator:

Target: Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing trait implementation block `impl MyTrait for SomeType`.
2. Within this block, add a new method that is not present in the trait definition. This method should have:
   - An asynchronous signature with the `async` keyword.
   - A return type different from those specified in the original trait.
   - Calls to existing trait methods using `await`, ensuring the new method interacts with them asynchronously.
3. Ensure the new method's signature and implementation use variables, types, or functions already declared in the seed program.

Example:
Original:
```rust
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async fn foo(&self) -> i32 {
        *self
    }

    async fn bar(&self) -> i32 {
        self.foo().await
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl MyTrait for i32 {
    async fn foo(&self) -> i32 {
        *self
    }

    async fn bar(&self) -> i32 {
        self.foo().await
    }

    // New method not in trait definition
    async fn baz(&self) -> String {
        let result = self.foo().await + self.bar().await;
        format!("Result: {}", result)
    }
}
```

This mutation adds complexity by introducing a method that uses existing asynchronous operations and interacts with the trait while having a different return type (`String` instead of `i32`), which may lead to unexpected behaviors and potential bugs when combined with `async_fn_in_trait`.
