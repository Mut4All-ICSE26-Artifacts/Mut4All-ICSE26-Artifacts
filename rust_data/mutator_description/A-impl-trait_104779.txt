Mutation Operator 1: Modify Enum Variant Patterns

Target Code Construct: Enum pattern matching in `match` expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing `match` expression involving an enum.
2. Replace the pattern in one of the match arms with a pattern that binds a variable instead of matching a specific constructor.
3. Ensure that the variable binding is correctly typed and used within the match arm.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
match foo() {
    Subtype::Bar => (),
    Supertype::Var(x) => {}
}
```

Mutation:
1. Replace `Subtype::Bar` pattern with `Subtype::Var(y)`.
2. Ensure `y` is utilized in the arm, such as by calling a function or performing an operation with `y`.

Mutated Code:
```rust
match foo() {
    Subtype::Var(y) => { process(y); },
    Supertype::Var(x) => {}
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets enum variant pattern matching, where mismatches or unintended variable bindings could trigger compiler bugs related to pattern matching logic in the presence of opaque types and subtyping.
