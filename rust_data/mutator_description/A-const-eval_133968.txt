Mutation Operator: Modify Static Lifetime Bound in Structs

Target Code Construct: Struct Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition with a reference type field having a static lifetime bound. For example, locate fields like `x: &'static T` in a struct.
2. Modify the lifetime bound to a non-static or generic lifetime. If no lifetime is specified, introduce one. For example, change `x: &'static T` to `x: &'a T` where `'a` is a lifetime parameter.
3. Ensure that the new lifetime parameter is properly declared in the struct definition. For example, update the struct definition to `struct B<'a, T: ?Sized + Send> { x: &'a T, }`.

Example Transformation:
Before Mutation:
```rust
struct A<T: 'static>(&'static T);
struct B<T: ?Sized + Send> {
    x: &'static T,
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
struct A<'a, T: 'a>(&'a T);
struct B<'a, T: ?Sized + Send> {
    x: &'a T,
}
```

By adjusting the lifetime to be non-static and dependent on a generic lifetime parameter, this mutation operator can uncover issues related to lifetime analysis and const evaluation in the compiler. The modification explores scenarios where static guarantees are relaxed, and lifetime inference becomes more dynamic, potentially revealing latent bugs.
