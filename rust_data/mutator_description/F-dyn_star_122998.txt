Mutation Operator: Alter Trait Object Syntax

Target Construct: Trait objects in variable declarations within functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate any trait object variable declaration in the function scope, such as `let variable_name: dyn Trait = &value;`.
2. Change the syntax of the trait object from using `dyn* Trait` to `dyn Trait` and vice versa.
3. Ensure that the type conversion or casting associated with this trait object is adjusted to match the change in the trait object syntax.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
```
fn example_function() {
    let y: dyn* TraitExample = &some_value;
    Box::new(y) as Box<dyn TraitExample>;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn example_function() {
    let y: dyn TraitExample = &some_value;
    Box::new(y) as Box<dyn TraitExample>;
}
```

Note: Verify that the trait `TraitExample` is an existing trait in the program and that `some_value` is of a type that implements this trait. If not, use a trait and value pair already defined within the scope.
