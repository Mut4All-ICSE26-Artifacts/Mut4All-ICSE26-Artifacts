Mutation Operator: Mutate Pattern Matching with References and Mutable References

Target: Applies to pattern matching constructs, specifically within `if let` and `match` expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an `if let` or `match` expression in the code that involves pattern matching with both references (`&`) and mutable references (`&mut`).
2. Change one instance of a reference pattern (`&`) to a mutable reference pattern (`&mut`), or vice versa.
3. Ensure that the variable or value being matched allows the mutability change (i.e., the original matched value should be mutable if changing to `&mut`).
4. If the matched data structure is immutable, attempt to mutate the structure itself to see the effect on pattern matching.

Example:
Original Code:
```
fn main() {
    if let &Some(Some(x)) = &Some(&mut Some(0)) {}
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn main() {
    if let &Some(Some(x)) = &Some(&Some(0)) {}
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation changes the inner `&mut Some(0)` to `&Some(0)`, altering the mutability reference within the pattern. This kind of change can probe the robustness of the compiler's handling of pattern mutability in nested structures. Adjustments should be made carefully to maintain correct syntax and logical consistency in the pattern matching.
