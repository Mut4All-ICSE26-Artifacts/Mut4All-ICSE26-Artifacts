Mutation Operator: Struct Array Size Modification

Target: Struct definition with an array field

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition that contains an array field. For example:
   ```rust
   pub struct Container([T; N]); // where N is a constant size
   ```

2. Modify the size of the array to be an extremely large value that is not practically manageable by typical system architectures. Change the constant size `N` to a large expression like `usize::MAX >> 1` or some other large constant value that may cause overflow or related issues during compilation.

3. Ensure the struct is used in a constant context or within a function where constant evaluation might be triggered. For example:
   ```rust
   const _: Container = unsafe { Container(std::mem::zeroed()) };
   ```

4. Validate that this change is made without introducing undeclared types or variables. Use an existing or declared type `T` for the struct's array element type.

Example Pseudo-code:
```rust
pub struct MyStruct([i32; usize::MAX >> 1]); // Adjust array size to trigger const-eval issues

const _: MyStruct = unsafe { MyStruct(std::mem::zeroed()) }; // Use in const context
```

This mutation operator targets the array size in struct definitions to stress the constant evaluation process of the Rust compiler, aiming to expose potential internal compiler errors or inefficiencies when handling extremely large data structures.
