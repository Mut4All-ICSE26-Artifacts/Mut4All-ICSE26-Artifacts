Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Associated Type

Target Code Construct: Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the seed program where the trait has an associated type. For example, in the provided code, the `Assoc` trait has an associated type `Output`.

2. Locate an implementation of this trait for a concrete type. In the provided code, `impl Assoc for u8` is an example where `Assoc` is implemented for `u8`.

3. Apply the following mutation:
   - Change the associated type of the concrete implementation to a different existing type or expression derived from the seed program, ensuring it is valid within the context. For instance, if `Output` is currently `bool`, change it to `u32` or any type that might already exist or be derivable in the seed program.

Example:
Original:
```
impl Assoc for u8 {
    type Output = bool;
}
```

Mutated:
```
impl Assoc for u8 {
    type Output = u32;
}
```

This mutation operator aims to trigger inconsistencies in trait implementations that use associated types, which could potentially lead to uncovering bugs related to specialization and trait coherence in the Rust compiler. Ensure that the type being substituted is part of the type system used in the seed program to maintain validity.
