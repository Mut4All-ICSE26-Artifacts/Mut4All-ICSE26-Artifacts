Mutation Operator

Target: Structs and Their Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct declaration that uses constant generic parameters.
2. If the struct and its implementation use different types for the constants, ensure they use the same type.
3. Modify the arithmetic operation involving the const parameters in the where clause to use mixed constant types (e.g., mixing `usize` and `i64` in operations).
4. Specifically, replace any consistent type arithmetic operation with an asymmetric operation that involves mismatched types, which likely confuses the type checker.
5. Introduce a dummy arithmetic operation involving the constants in the struct's implementation, ensuring it triggers evaluation within the `where` clause.

Example:

Before Mutation:
```rust
struct Container<const X: i64, const Y: usize>();
impl<const X: i64, const Y: usize> Container<X, Y>
where
    [(); (X + Y) as usize]:,
{
    fn new() {}
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
struct Container<const X: i64, const Y: usize>();
impl<const X: usize, const Y: usize> Container<X, Y>
where
    [(); X + (Y * 2)]:,
{
    fn new() {
        let _ = X + (Y * 2) as i64; // Intentional type mix that causes evaluation
    }
}
```

Note: This operator utilizes the same constants from the seed program and modifies their operations to create scenarios that are prone to evaluation issues, potentially triggering compile-time errors.
