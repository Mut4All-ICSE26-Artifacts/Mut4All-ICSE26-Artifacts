Mutation Operator: Modify Lifetime Annotations in Trait Methods

- Target: Trait methods with lifetime annotations
- Mutation Rule:
  1. Identify a trait in the program that has a method with lifetime annotations, for example `trait Example { fn method<'lifetime1: 'lifetime2>() -> ...; }`.
  2. Modify the lifetime annotations such that they are in conflict or semantically incorrect but still syntactically valid. This involves changing the lifetime dependencies or introducing an unrelated lifetime that does not affect return types or parameters. For example, if the original method is `fn method<'a: 'b>() -> impl Trait + 'b`, mutate it to `fn method<'a, 'b>() -> impl Trait + 'a`.
  3. Ensure that the implementation of the trait or the use of the trait remains unchanged to focus the mutation effect on the lifetime annotations in the method signature.
  
- Example:
  Original:
  ```rust
  trait Processor {
      fn process<'short: 'long>() -> impl Sized + 'long;
  }
  ```

  Mutated:
  ```rust
  trait Processor {
      fn process<'short, 'long>() -> impl Sized + 'short;
  }
  ```

- Explanation: This mutation targets the relationships between lifetimes in function signatures within traits. By altering these relationships to an incorrect but syntactically valid state, it increases the likelihood of triggering compiler bugs related to lifetime handling, especially in complex scenarios involving return types with lifetimes.
