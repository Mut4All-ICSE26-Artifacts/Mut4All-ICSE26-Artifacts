Mutation Operator: Modify Closure's Parameter List to Include Const Generics

This mutation operator targets closures, specifically those parameterized with const generics within the parameter list of the closure. The operator aims to reproduce scenarios similar to the bug report where utilizing const generics in closures causes a compiler crash.

Steps:
1. Identify a closure within the Rust code. The closure should be in a context where it could potentially have parameters (e.g., within a function or a direct assignment to a variable).
2. Modify the closure's parameter list to introduce a const generic. This involves:
   a. Adding a `for<const N: Type>` clause before the closure parameters, where `Type` is a compatible numeric type (e.g., `i32`, `u32`, etc.).
   b. Ensure that the const generic is not utilized within the closure body, as per the observed bug behavior.
3. Compile the modified code to determine if the mutation leads to a compiler crash.

Example:
Original Closure:
```
let my_closure = || println!("Hello, World!");
```

Modified Closure:
```
let my_closure = for<const N: i32> || println!("Hello, World!");
```

Note: The mutation operator should not introduce new types or variables apart from the const generic. It assumes that the introduction of the const generic itself is the potential trigger for compiler instability, as evidenced by the provided bug report. This mutation operator is designed to be universally applicable to any closure present in the seed program, enhancing its coverage across various code structures.
