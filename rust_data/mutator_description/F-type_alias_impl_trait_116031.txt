Mutation Operator:

Target: Type Alias with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias that uses the `impl Trait` syntax. This type alias should be declared outside of any function, typically at the module level.
2. Inspect the nested `impl Trait` that resides within another `impl Trait`. In the example, this is the usage of `impl Iterator` inside the `impl Iterator<Item = ...>`.
3. Replace the nested `impl Trait` with a concrete type or another trait that does not involve `impl Trait`. You can use a simple iterator type like `std::vec::IntoIter<T>` or define a trait that suits the context.
4. Ensure that the replacement type adheres to the expected trait bounds or item definitions required by the outer `impl Trait`.

Example Pseudocode:

Original:
```rust
pub type Tait = impl Iterator<Item = (Key, impl Iterator)>;
```

Mutated:
```rust
pub type Tait = impl Iterator<Item = (Key, std::vec::IntoIter<usize>)>;
```

Explanation:
- The operator targets type aliases using `impl Trait`, particularly when `impl Trait` is nested.
- The mutation replaces the inner `impl Trait` with a concrete iterator type.
- This mutation maintains the trait bound expectations of the outer `impl Trait` while removing the nested `impl Trait`, which is prone to causing bugs.
- The mutation is designed to provoke changes in how the compiler resolves type information and may expose latent bugs in the handling of type aliasing with `impl Trait`.
