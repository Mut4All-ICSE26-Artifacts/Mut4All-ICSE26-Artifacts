Based on the provided Rust compiler bug report, the structures that are more likely to trigger such bugs include the use of incomplete or unstable features such as `inherent_associated_types` and `generic_const_exprs`, as well as complex type manipulations involving const generics and associated types. The bug seems to be triggered by a mismatch in expected and actual types during the substitution process within the compiler's type system.

Mutation Operator:

Target: Struct Implementations with Const Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition that uses const generics and has an associated type defined within an `impl` block.
2. Within the `impl` block, locate the associated type definition that uses a const expression.
3. Modify the const expression in the associated type definition to introduce a different mathematical operation or use a different const generic parameter.
4. Ensure the new const expression remains valid Rust syntax but changes the expected type or value.

Step-by-step:
- Locate the struct and impl block:
  ```rust
  struct Parent<const O: usize>;
  
  impl<const O: usize> Parent<O> {
      type Mapping<const I: usize> = Store<{ O + I }>;
  }
  ```
- Change the const expression in the associated type definition:
  ```rust
  // Original
  type Mapping<const I: usize> = Store<{ O + I }>;
  
  // Mutated: Change addition to multiplication
  type Mapping<const I: usize> = Store<{ O * I }>;
  ```
- Ensure that the rest of the code using this associated type remains unchanged to observe the effects of the mutation.

This mutation operator specifically targets the use of const expressions within associated types, which is a potential source for compiler internal errors due to the complexity involved in type substitution and const evaluation. The mutation is designed to introduce subtle changes that test the robustness of the compiler's handling of const generics and associated types.
