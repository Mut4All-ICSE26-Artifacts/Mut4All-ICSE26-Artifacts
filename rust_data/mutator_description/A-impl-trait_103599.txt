Mutation Operator

Target: Function with recursive calls and `impl Trait` return type

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that has a return type of `impl Trait`, where `Trait` is a trait defined in the source code.
2. Ensure the function calls itself recursively.
3. Introduce an additional function that represents another level of indirection:
   - Define a new function that accepts the same parameter(s) and returns `impl Trait`.
   - Within the new function, call the original function recursively using the provided parameter(s).
4. Update all original recursive calls in the seed program to be indirect through the new function.

Example:

Original:
```rust
trait T {}

fn process(x: impl T) -> impl T {
    process(x)
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
trait T {}

fn process(x: impl T) -> impl T {
    indirect_process(x)
}

fn indirect_process(x: impl T) -> impl T {
    process(x)
}
```

This mutation creates an additional layer of function calls which could induce complexities in the compiler's handling of recursive functions with `impl Trait` return types, potentially triggering compiler bugs or exposing weaknesses in trait resolution mechanisms.
