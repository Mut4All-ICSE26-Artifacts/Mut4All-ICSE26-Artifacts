Mutation Operator: Modify Struct Const Parameter with Invalid Default

Target: Structs with const parameters

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with const parameters in the Rust program.
2. Select one of the const parameters that has a default value specified.
3. Change the default value to a type or expression that is incompatible with the expected type of the const parameter.
4. Ensure that the incompatible type or expression is still syntactically correct to pass initial parsing.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct<const N: usize = 10>;
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct<const N: usize = "invalid"; // Changed default value to a string
```

This mutation operator targets struct const parameters and modifies the default value to an incompatible type, which is likely to trigger compiler errors related to generic const expressions and type checking. By changing the default to a type that cannot be coerced into the expected type, the mutation exploits potential weaknesses in the compiler's handling of const generics.
