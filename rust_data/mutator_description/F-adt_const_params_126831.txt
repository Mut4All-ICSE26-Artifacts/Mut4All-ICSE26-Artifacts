Mutation Operator: Modify Constant Array Elements

Target Construct: Array and Struct

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constant array declaration in the program. For example, `const BRIDGES: [(usize, usize); 7]`.
2. Modify the elements within the array to introduce variations in the data, ensuring that types are consistent with the original type. For example, change the tuple contents in a way that alters their uniqueness or repetition.
3. Reflect these changes in the constant constructs that depend on this array, such as structs or functions that utilize these constants.
4. Ensure the modified elements of the array do not exceed the boundaries of the array size or type constraints.

Example (in Pseudo-code):
Original:
```rust
const BRIDGES: [(usize, usize); 7] = [(0, 1), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)];
```

Mutated:
```rust
const BRIDGES: [(usize, usize); 7] = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 3), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 2)];
```

Application:
- This mutation applies to any arrays used as constants in type parameters, especially when these arrays influence the behavior of structs with constant generic parameters.
- Ensure that any changes reflect logically consistent alterations within the context of the program's domain, especially if the array influences matrix operations or other structural data handling.

This approach utilizes existing elements within the seed program, modifies them in a targeted manner, and has the potential to expose bugs in constant evaluation or type checking within the Rust compiler.
