Mutation Operator:
This mutation operator targets closure definitions within functions. It aims to trigger potential issues by altering the closure's return type.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a closure defined within a function. This closure should have a return type that is a primitive data type (e.g., u8, i32).
2. Modify the return type of the closure to another compatible primitive data type that requires implicit or explicit type conversion. For example, if the closure returns an `u8`, change it to return an `i16`.
3. Ensure the return statement within the closure is adjusted to match the new return type. For example, if the closure initially returns `123u8`, modify it to `123 as i16`.
4. Ensure that the new return type is compatible with the surrounding code that calls or uses the closure.

Example Pseudo-code Transformation:
Original Code:
```
fn main() {
    let func = || 123u8;
    func();
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn main() {
    let func = || 123 as i16;  // Changed return type from u8 to i16
    func();
}
```

Rationale:
This mutation operator specifically targets the use of closures and their return types, which can impact the MIR inlining and lead to potential compiler issues. Adjusting the return type can expose unexpected behavior in optimizations or type conversions that the Rust compiler must handle.
