Based on the bug report, Rust compiler bugs are often triggered by incorrect or missing type definitions. In this case, the use of an undefined type `Oops` triggers a bug in the inline assembly context. To design mutation operators that are more likely to cause similar bugs, we can focus on introducing type-related inconsistencies within the code, especially in contexts involving inline assembly or advanced type manipulations.

Mutation Operator: Undefined Type in Struct Declaration

Target Construct: Struct Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify struct definitions in the existing seed program.
2. Within the tuple struct or regular struct declaration, introduce a field with a type that is not defined in the current scope.
3. Ensure that the undefined type is referenced within a context that involves inline assembly or any advanced Rust feature that may not handle such errors gracefully.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct<T: ?Sized>(T);
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct<T: ?Sized>(UndefinedType);
// Note: 'UndefinedType' is not declared anywhere in the program.
```

Steps:
1. Scan for any struct definitions in the seed program.
2. Select a field within the struct and replace its type with a new type identifier that is not declared in the program, such as `UndefinedType`.
3. Do not declare or define `UndefinedType` in the program to ensure it remains undefined. This will lead to a situation where the compiler has to handle an unexpected type, potentially triggering errors similar to the bug in the report.

By focusing on undefined types within struct declarations, especially in contexts that are more complex, like inline assembly or generics, this mutation operator can potentially trigger compiler issues or highlight areas where error handling may be insufficient.
