Mutation Operator: Alter Type Aliases in Structs

Target Code Construct:
- Struct definitions using type aliases for their fields.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that uses a type alias in its field declaration. For example, `struct LayerPage<L: LayerT> { buffer: Arc<PooledNdBuffer<L::DataType>> }`.
2. Replace the type alias in the struct field with a direct type expression that the alias represents. In the example, replace `PooledNdBuffer<L::DataType>` with its expanded type `Pooled<NdBuffer<L::DataType>>`.
3. Ensure that the direct type expression is semantically equivalent to the type alias.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
type NdBuffer<T> = NdBufferView<(), T>;
type PooledNdBuffer<T> = Pooled<NdBuffer<T>>;

struct LayerPage<L: LayerT> {
    buffer: Arc<PooledNdBuffer<L::DataType>>,
}
```

Mutated:
```
struct LayerPage<L: LayerT> {
    buffer: Arc<Pooled<NdBufferView<(), L::DataType>>>,
}
```

This mutation targets the use of type aliases within structs, replacing them with their equivalent concrete types. This can reveal issues in how type aliases are handled in the context of trait bounds and generics, potentially triggering compiler bugs related to the type system.
