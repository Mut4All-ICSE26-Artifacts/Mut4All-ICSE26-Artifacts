Mutation Operator: Alter Const Parameter Width in Struct Definitions

Target: Struct definitions using const generics, particularly when utilizing arrays or other composite types as const parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct declaration that uses an array type as a const parameter, such as `pub struct Example<const PARAM: [usize; N]>`.
2. Change the size of the array in the const parameter to be inconsistent with the array size passed during the instantiation of the struct. If the original size is `[N]`, modify it to `[N+1]` or `[N-1]`.
3. Ensure that the instantiation uses the unchanged type. For example, if the original struct is defined as `pub struct Example<const PARAM: [usize; 1]>`, an instantiation should attempt to use `[0; 2]` or `[0; 0]`.
4. Maintain any existing type definitions or constants but adjust their usage to match the new array size in the instantiation.

Example:
Consider the code snippet:
```
pub struct Sample<const PARAM: [usize; 1]> {}
```
Mutate it by changing the array size:
```
pub struct Sample<const PARAM: [usize; 2]> {}

const CHANGED_CONST: [usize; 2] = [0; 2];

impl Sample<CHANGED_CONST> {
    pub const fn create() -> Self {
        Self {}
    }
}

fn main() {
    let instance = Sample::create();
}
```
This mutation can potentially expose issues related to how the Rust compiler handles const generic parameters with varying array sizes, often leading to internal compiler errors if the handling of such relationships is incomplete or erroneous.
