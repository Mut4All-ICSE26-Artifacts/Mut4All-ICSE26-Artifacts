Mutation Operator: Modify Use of Associated Constants in Trait Implementations

Target: Applies to trait implementations involving associated constants.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a trait that has an associated constant, for example: `trait SampleTrait { const VALUE: usize; }`.

2. Locate an implementation of this trait where the associated constant is used in a type that relies on const expressions.
   Example:
   ```
   impl SampleTrait for SomeType {
       const VALUE: usize = 10;
   }

   struct Container<[(); SomeType::VALUE]> {
       field: u32,
   }
   ```

3. Introduce ambiguity or inference challenges by changing the way the associated constant is referenced in the type. Specifically, modify the usage so that it causes potential inference issues during compilation.

   Change:
   Replace direct usage with an indirect or ambiguous reference that depends on type inference, such as using a default value or a complex type expression without clear specification.

   Example change:
   Original:
   ```
   struct Container<[(); SomeType::VALUE]> {
       field: u32,
   }
   ```

   Mutated:
   ```
   struct Container<[(); get_value::<SomeType>()]> {
       field: u32,
   }

   fn get_value<T: SampleTrait>() -> usize {
       T::VALUE
   }
   ```

   The mutation introduces a function that retrieves the constant, potentially causing inference or evaluation issues.

4. Ensure that the mutation does not introduce undeclared types or functions unless they are defined within the scope of the changes, as shown in the example with `get_value`.

By following this mutation operator, the goal is to create conditions that stress the compiler's ability to correctly evaluate associated constants in contexts where type inference plays a significant role, potentially leading to bugs or crashes in the compiler.
