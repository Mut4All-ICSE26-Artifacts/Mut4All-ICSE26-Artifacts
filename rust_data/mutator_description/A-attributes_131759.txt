Mutation Operator: Modify Configuration Attributes

Target: Attribute Macros (specifically `cfg` attributes)

Mutation Rule:
This mutation operator targets the `cfg` attribute macro and specifically alters the conditions within the `cfg` expressions to test the compiler's handling of these attributes.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a `cfg` attribute in the seed program, such as `#[cfg(condition)]`.
2. Modify the `condition` part of the `cfg` attribute. The aim is to introduce unexpected or edge-case values that could trigger a bug in the compiler.
3. Use the following mutation pattern: Replace `target` and its value with a non-standard or experimental target specification.
   - Example: Change `#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]` to `#[cfg(target(128::MAX, true))]`, or use other integer limits or reserved words not typically associated with `target`.
4. Ensure the modification does not introduce syntax errors. The goal is to create logically valid but semantically unusual configurations.
5. Apply this mutation to various `cfg` attributes throughout the program to maximize coverage.

Example before mutation:
```rust
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
fn linux_only_function() {
    // Implementation
}
```

Example after mutation:
```rust
#[cfg(target(128::MAX, true))]
fn linux_only_function() {
    // Implementation
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to explore how the Rust compiler handles non-standard `cfg` conditions, potentially uncovering issues with attribute parsing and evaluation. By using limits and reserved values, it increases the likelihood of triggering unusual behavior in the compiler's attribute-handling logic.
