Mutation Operator:
Target: Trait implementation with associated types, specifically for traits involving specialization and associated types.
Objective: Modify the associated type in a trait implementation to a different existing type in the seed program.

Step-by-step instructions:
1. Identify a trait in the seed program that has an associated type. This can often be seen in the form of `trait TraitName { type AssociatedType; }`.
2. Find an implementation of this trait for some type `T` (e.g., `impl TraitName for T { type AssociatedType = ...; }`).
3. Change the `type AssociatedType` in the implementation to a different type that is already defined in the seed program. Ensure that this new type is fundamentally different from the expected one (e.g., if the original type was a concrete type like `i32`, change it to a different existing concrete type like `str` or `()`).

Example:
Original Implementation:
```rust
trait ToOwned {
    type Owned;
}

impl ToOwned for str {
    type Owned = String;
}
```

Mutated Implementation:
```rust
impl ToOwned for str {
    type Owned = ();
}
```

Note: The key is to ensure that the new type is incompatible or semantically different from the original intended use, which is likely to increase the chance of triggering specialization coherence issues in the Rust compiler.
