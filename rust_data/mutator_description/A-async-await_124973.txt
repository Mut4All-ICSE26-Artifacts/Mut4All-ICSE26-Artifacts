Mutation Operator: Alter Lifetime Annotations on Async Functions

Target: This mutation operator targets async functions with multiple lifetime annotations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an async function in the source code that has multiple lifetime parameters (e.g., `async fn foo<'a, 'b>(...) {...}`).
2. Remove all but one lifetime annotation from the function signature. If only one lifetime annotation is left, remove it as well to simplify the function signature.

Example:
Before Mutation: 
```rust
async fn example_function<'a, 'b>(param1: &'a str, param2: &'b str) -> &'a str {
    param1
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
async fn example_function(param1: &str, param2: &str) -> &str {
    param1
}
```

The goal of this operator is to trigger potential compiler issues related to lifetime resolution in async functions. Removing or simplifying lifetime annotations might expose weaknesses in handling lifetimes, especially in more complex scenarios involving async/await. This operator ensures that the code remains syntactically correct but challenges the compiler's ability to infer lifetimes accurately.
