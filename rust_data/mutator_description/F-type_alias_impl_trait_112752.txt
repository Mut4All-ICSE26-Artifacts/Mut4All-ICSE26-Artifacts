Mutation Operator: Modify Static Variable Declaration

Target: Static Variables with Type Aliases

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the static variable declaration that uses a type alias with `impl Trait` in the seed program. In this example, it is `static mut TEST: Option<Debuggable> = None;`.
2. Change the type of the static variable from `Option<Debuggable>` to another wrapper type like `Result<Debuggable, E>`, where `E` is an error type that can be inferred or is already defined in the seed program.
3. Ensure the changed static variable is initialized appropriately. For example, instead of `None`, use something like `Err(<appropriate value for E>)`.

Example:
Original code:
```rust
static mut TEST: Option<Debuggable> = None;
```

Mutated code:
```rust
static mut TEST: Result<Debuggable, &'static str> = Err("Initialization error");
```

This mutation leverages the usage of type aliases with `impl Trait` in static contexts, which are prone to triggering compiler bugs, as observed in the provided bug report.
