Mutation Operator: Attribute Misplacement in Let Bindings

Target: This mutation operator targets let bindings in Rust code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify let bindings within the Rust code. These are typically lines or blocks starting with the keyword `let` followed by a pattern, an optional type annotation, and an initializer.
2. Select a valid attribute that can be applied to let bindings. Common attributes include lint attributes like `#[allow()]` or `#[deny()]`. However, for this mutation, focus on attributes not typically associated with let bindings, such as `#[cfg()]` without proper conditions or invalid attributes.
3. Place the attribute directly before the initialization expression of the let binding. Ensure the attribute is malformed or incorrectly used, similar to `#[cfg()]` without a condition or with incorrect syntax.
4. Example Transformation:
   - Original: 
     ```rust
     let x = 42;
     ```
   - Mutated: 
     ```rust
     let x = #[cfg_invalid] 42;
     ```
5. Ensure that the mutated code includes attributes with incorrect syntax or misplaced attributes, which are likely to trigger parser errors or ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors).

This mutation is likely to expose bugs related to the parser's handling of attributes in unexpected positions, particularly within expressions or initializations, and aligns with the characteristics of the provided bug report.
