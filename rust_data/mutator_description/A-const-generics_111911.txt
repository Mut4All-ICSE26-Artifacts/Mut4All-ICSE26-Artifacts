Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Types with Lifetimes in Function Signatures

Target: This mutation operator targets function signatures that utilize const generics with lifetimes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition that uses a const generic parameter with a lifetime, such as a const reference.
2. Modify the lifetime specifier of the const generic parameter. If a lifetime specifier is already present, alter it to a different existing lifetime or introduce a new lifetime specifier.
3. Ensure the rest of the code remains compatible with this change by adjusting variable lifetimes accordingly, if necessary.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub async fn foo<const X: &'static str>() {}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
// Introduce a new lifetime 'a or use an existing one
pub async fn foo<const X: &'a str>() {}
```

Instructions:
- Identify a const generic type with a lifetime in a function signature.
- Modify the lifetime either by changing it to another existing lifetime or by introducing a new one.
- Ensure any related function calls or usage sites are adjusted for the new lifetime if they involve the const generic parameter.
- Validate that the program remains syntactically correct post-mutation.
