Mutation Operator: Modify PhantomData Usage

This mutation targets the usage of `PhantomData` within struct definitions. The operator aims to modify the `PhantomData` type parameter to increase the chances of triggering a compiler bug related to associated items and trait systems.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that utilizes `PhantomData`, such as `struct Pooled<B>`.
2. Change the type parameter within `PhantomData` to a different, yet compatible type that already exists in the seed program. This type should still maintain the intended semantics but alter the associated type relationship.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct Pooled<B> {
    _buffer: PhantomData<B>,
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct Pooled<B> {
    _buffer: PhantomData<NdBufferView<(), B>>,
}
```

Explanation:
In this example, the type parameter `B` in `PhantomData` is replaced with `NdBufferView<(), B>`. This mutation operates on the construct of `PhantomData`, which is a zero-sized type used to mark ownership of a type, and alters it to potentially impact the associated items and trait system interactions, increasing the likelihood of triggering a compiler issue.
