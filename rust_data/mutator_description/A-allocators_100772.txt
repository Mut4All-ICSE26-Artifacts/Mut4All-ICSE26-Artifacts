Mutation Operator

Target: Function Calls with Box and Allocator API

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify function calls that use `Box::new_in` with an allocator argument, such as `&std::alloc::Global`.
2. Introduce multiple mutable references to the same data within the `Box::new_in` call, simulating potential allocator mismanagement.
3. Modify the function call to include a mutable reference to the elements being boxed.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
fn main() {
    Box::new_in(&[0, 1], &std::alloc::Global);
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
fn main() {
    let data = &mut [0, 1];
    Box::new_in(data, &std::alloc::Global);
}
```

This mutation operator targets potential issues with allocator API interactions by introducing mutable references that can lead to undefined behavior, which might trigger bugs within the Rust compiler's handling of memory allocations and sanitizers.
