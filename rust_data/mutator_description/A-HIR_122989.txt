Mutation Operator

Target: Trait Definitions with Associated Constants

Mutation Rule: Modify the associated constants in trait definitions that have default values using other constants or expressions to introduce circular references or unexpected dependencies.

1. Identify a trait definition in the seed program that includes associated constants. These are typically found in the format: `trait TraitName<const N: Type = DefaultValue>`.
2. Modify the default value of one of these associated constants to create a circular reference or dependency that might confuse the compiler. For instance, set the constant to refer to itself or another constant in the trait that might not yet be fully resolved.
3. Ensure that the modified value makes sense syntactically but introduces a semantic issue that the compiler must handle. Use existing constants or expressions present in the seed program to make this modification.
4. Verify that the trait still compiles after the mutation to ensure the mutation is valid within the context of the trait definition.

Example: 

Original Trait Definition:
```
trait ExampleTrait<const X: usize = 1> {
    // Method or other associated items
}
```

Mutation:
```
trait ExampleTrait<const X: usize = X + 1> {
    // Method or other associated items
}
```

In this example, `X` is set to a default value that is a circular reference. The original constant `X` defaults to `1`, but in the mutation, it defaults to a self-referential expression `X + 1`. This mutation exploits the compiler's handling of type-level constants and triggers compiler behavior when evaluating constants with potential circular dependencies or unexpected evaluation paths.
