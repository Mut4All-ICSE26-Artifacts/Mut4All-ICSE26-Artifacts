Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Rules to Remove Unsupported Syntax

Target Code Construct: Macro (macro_rules!)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the macro definition in the Rust code that uses the `box` syntax.
2. Replace the `box` keyword with standard heap allocation syntax using `Box::new()`.
3. Ensure that the macro will still function correctly by adjusting any necessary type annotations or expected return types.

Example:
Original Macro:
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make {
    () => { box 0 }
}
```

Mutated Macro:
```rust
#[macro_export]
macro_rules! make {
    () => { Box::new(0) }
}
```

Explanation:
- Locate the use of the `box` keyword within macro rules, which has been removed or deprecated in the Rust compiler's syntax.
- Transition to using the `Box::new()` function, which is the current and supported method for creating heap-allocated values in Rust.
- This mutation targets syntax changes that may not be directly recognized by the parser, potentially triggering parsing errors or unexpected behavior due to outdated syntax.
