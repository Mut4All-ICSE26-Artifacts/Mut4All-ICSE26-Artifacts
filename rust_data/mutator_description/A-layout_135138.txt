Based on the provided bug report, the issue appears to involve the use of the `#![feature(trivial_bounds)]` feature, specifically in the context of dealing with the `Sized` trait and const evaluation. The presence of a constant array size that involves a type with trivial bounds seems to trigger an internal compiler error (ICE). The structures that are more likely to trigger such bugs often involve unconventional or edge-case type constraints, especially when they intersect with const evaluations or bounds that should be trivially satisfied.

Mutation Operator:

Target: Function with type constraints and const evaluations.

Mutation Rule: Modify the type constraints and array initialization within a function to force unexpected const evaluation logic.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that utilizes a type constraint, especially the `Sized` or `Copy` trait.
2. Within this function, introduce an array that depends on a const expression involving a type with a trivial bound. For example, use a type that normally cannot satisfy the `Sized` trait, such as `str`, and apply a trivial bound to force it.
3. Ensure that the array size is derived from a block that initializes a variable with a complex type operation, e.g., an `Option<T>` where `T` is a type that does not normally satisfy the constraint.
4. Example in pseudo-code:
   ```
   fn example_function()
   where
       NotSizedType: Sized,
   {
       [(); { let _temp: Option<NotSizedType> = None; 0 }];
   }
   ```
   - Replace `NotSizedType` with a type like `str` or a user-defined type that naturally does not satisfy `Sized`.
   - Ensure that the initialization block contains a type operation that forces const evaluation, like initializing an `Option<NotSizedType>` with `None`.

This mutation operator targets the intersection of type constraints and const evaluations, aiming to provoke unexpected behavior by violating typical type assumptions while relying on trivial bounds that can confuse the compiler's const evaluation logic.
