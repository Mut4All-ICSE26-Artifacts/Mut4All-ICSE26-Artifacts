Mutation Operator: Modify Array Size in Async Functions

Target Construct: 
This mutation operator targets array declarations within asynchronous functions. 

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an array initialization within an async function.
2. Change the size of the array to the largest possible usize value, which is usize::MAX (this is dependent on the target architecture, for example, on a 64-bit system, it is typically 2^64 - 1).
3. Ensure that the array type is usize or another large size-appropriate type.
4. The array should be used with an async construct, such as async function calls or .await expressions, to leverage async-related code paths.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
async fn example_function() {
    let array = [1usize; 10];
    example_async_function(array).await;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
async fn example_function() {
    let array = [1usize; usize::MAX];
    example_async_function(array).await;
}
```

Explanation: 
This mutation operator increases the array size within an async function to its maximum theoretical limit, which can cause overflow or excessive memory allocation in the Rust compiler, potentially triggering bugs similar to those related to async-await handling.
