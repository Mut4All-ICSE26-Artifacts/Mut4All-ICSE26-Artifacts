Mutation Operator: Modify Const Trait Implementation with Lifetime Annotations

Target: Function 

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a const function that returns an opaque type using `impl const Fn()` or similar constructs.

2. Modify the return type to explicitly include lifetime annotations for parameters. For example, change `impl const Fn()` to `impl const Fn() + '_` or introduce a lifetime parameter, such as `impl const Fn() + 'a` where `'a` is a lifetime you introduce.

3. If the function uses lifetime-bound parameters, ensure to declare a lifetime at the beginning of the function signature. For example, change from `const fn test() -> impl const Fn()` to `const fn test<'a>() -> impl const Fn() + 'a`.

4. Ensure that the introduced lifetime is used consistently within the function body if necessary, especially when dealing with references or borrowed data.

5. In scenarios where the function includes closures or lambdas, ensure these are updated to respect the new lifetime requirements if they are interacting with data bound to the introduced lifetime.

Example:

Before Mutation:
```rust
const fn test() -> impl const Fn() {
    const move || {
        let data: &[u8] = b"example";
        // function logic
    }
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
const fn test<'a>() -> impl const Fn() + 'a {
    const move || {
        let data: &'a [u8] = b"example";
        // function logic
    }
}
```

The mutation operator encourages the compiler to make additional checks regarding lifetimes, potentially triggering bugs related to lifetime handling in const trait implementations.
