Mutation Operator: Misuse of Built-in Attributes

Target Code Construct: Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that is annotated with attributes.
2. Modify the attribute to utilize a built-in attribute that is either not meant to be used in that context or is incorrectly formed.
3. Use an attribute like `#[inline]` but apply it incorrectly or use a non-existent variation of an attribute (e.g., `#[inline::always]`).
4. Ensure the attribute is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect, so that it triggers unexpected behavior in the compiler.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
#[inline]
fn example_function() {
    println!("This is an example function.");
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
#[inline::always]
fn example_function() {
    println!("This is an example function.");
}
```

Explanation: The mutation targets the function by altering its attribute to a form that should not be recognized by the compiler. This misuse of built-in attributes can expose weaknesses in how the compiler handles attribute parsing and application, potentially leading to internal compiler errors.
