Mutation Operator: Attribute Modification in Structs

Target: Struct definitions that contain attributes above field declarations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the seed program that has one or more fields.
2. Check if there are any attributes applied to the struct fields. If no attributes are present, add a new attribute. Otherwise, proceed to step 3.
3. Introduce a malformed or non-standard attribute to a field in the struct. For example, replace or prepend an existing attribute with a fake or incorrect one.
4. Ensure the attribute format is incorrect by using a pattern that resembles known attributes but with a deliberate syntax or semantic error.
5. The attribute should be in the form #[fake_attribute::unknown] or #[existing_attribute::malformed].

Example:
Original:
```
struct Example {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}
```

Mutated:
```
struct Example {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    #[fake_attribute::unknown]
    field1: i32,
    #[existing_attribute::malformed]
    field2: String,
}
```

Explanation:
- Introduced `#[fake_attribute::unknown]` and `#[existing_attribute::malformed]` as malformed attributes to the struct fields.
- This mutation targets the attribute handling logic in the compiler, likely triggering errors related to attribute parsing or handling, similar to the issue described in the bug report.
- By introducing attributes with intentional errors, this mutation probes the compiler's ability to handle unexpected and invalid attribute patterns, potentially leading to crashes or ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors).
