Mutation Operator:
1. **Target Code Construct**: Enum with constant expressions involving its own variants.
2. **Applicable To**: Enum definitions where at least one variant is defined using a constant expression that references the enum's own variants.
3. **Mutation Rule**:
   a. Identify any constant expressions in the enum that use arithmetic operations on the enum's own variants.
   b. Change the assigned value of one variant to another arithmetic expression that still refers to the enum's variants but introduces a cycle, such as referencing the current variant indirectly through another variant.
   c. Ensure the expression logically results in an out-of-bounds or undefined behavior (e.g., by using operations like addition that may cause overflow).

Example of Mutated Content:
- Original:
  ```rust
  #[repr(u8)]
  enum T<const N: u8 = { T::<0>::A as u8 + T::<0>::B as u8 }> {
      A = 1, B
  }
  ```

- Mutated:
  ```rust
  #[repr(u8)]
  enum T<const N: u8 = { T::<0>::B as u8 - T::<0>::A as u8 }> {
      A = 1, B = T::<0>::A as u8 - 1
  }
  ```
In this mutated version, the expression for B attempts to reference A in a way that creates a non-trivial evaluation, potentially causing cyclical reference errors or arithmetic issues when evaluated at compile time.
