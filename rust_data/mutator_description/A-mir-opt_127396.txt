Mutation Operator: Unsafe Transmute in Function Context

Target: Function Definitions

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a function definition within the seed program. This function should have a return type of a basic numeric data type, such as `u64`.
2. Within the function body, locate a variable declaration with an `Option<T>` type, where `T` is a basic numeric data type (e.g., `Option<u32>`).
3. Instead of directly transmuting the `Option<T>` variable to a basic numeric type within the main function, refactor the code to perform the transmutation within a helper function.
4. Declare a new unsafe function, named `transmute_option`, that takes in an `Option<T>` parameter and returns the specified basic numeric type (e.g., `u64`).
5. Implement the function body of `transmute_option` to perform `std::mem::transmute` on the `Option<T>` argument and return the result.
6. In the original function, call `transmute_option` with the `Option<T>` variable and assign the result to the original transmuted variable.

Example:

Original Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let variant: Option<u32> = None;
    let transmuted: u64 = unsafe {
        std::mem::transmute(variant)
    };
    println!("{transmuted}");
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let variant: Option<u32> = None;
    let transmuted = transmute_option(variant);
    println!("{transmuted}");
}

unsafe fn transmute_option(option: Option<u32>) -> u64 {
    std::mem::transmute(option)
}
```

This mutation operator focuses on separating the transmutation logic into a standalone function, which could affect how the compiler optimizes or handles the code, potentially triggering latent bugs related to MIR optimization or code generation.
