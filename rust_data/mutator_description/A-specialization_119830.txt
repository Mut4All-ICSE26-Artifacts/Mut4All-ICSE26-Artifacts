Mutation Operator: Alter Trait Implementations with Const

Target Construct: Impl Blocks with Const Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an impl block in the seed program that implements a trait without involving const.
2. Modify the impl block to attempt implementing the trait as a const trait implementation, even if the trait is not marked with #[const_trait]. 
3. Example:
   - Original Code:
     ```
     impl<T> MyTrait for T {}
     ```
   - Mutated Code:
     ```
     impl<T> const MyTrait for T {}
     ```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the implementation of traits by introducing const in the trait impl block. This is likely to expose issues similar to those described in the bug report, where the const trait impls may lead to compiler errors due to the traits not being appropriately marked with #[const_trait]. This can trigger multiple errors, including those related to the experimental nature of const trait impls, unconstrained const parameters, and potential internal compiler errors (ICEs) if the compiler encounters unexpected situations during resolution or analysis phases.
