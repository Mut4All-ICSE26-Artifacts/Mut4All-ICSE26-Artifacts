Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Associated Types to Remove Const Expressions

Target: This mutation operator targets the definition of associated types within a trait or an implementation that involves generic const expressions, specifically focusing on their constraints.

Step-by-step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait or an implementation that defines an associated type involving generic const expressions, such as `type LendingFooIter<'a, F: Foo>: Iterator<Item = F::Bar> where [(); F::N]:;`.
2. Remove the const expression constraints from the associated type definition. For instance, eliminate the `[(); F::N]:;` constraint.
3. Ensure that any dependent code that uses the associated type is adjusted to accommodate the removal of the const expression constraints. This might involve altering function signatures, bounds, or removing related expressions that depend on the const constraint.

Example:
Original Code:
```
trait Owner {
    type LendingFooIter<'a, F: Foo>: Iterator<Item = F::Bar>
    where
        [(); F::N]:;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
trait Owner {
    type LendingFooIter<'a, F: Foo>: Iterator<Item = F::Bar>;
}
```

In this example, the constraint `[(); F::N]:;` is removed from the associated type definition. This mutation targets potential compiler bugs linked to constraints involving generic const expressions by simplifying the type's requirements and testing the compiler's handling of such changes.
