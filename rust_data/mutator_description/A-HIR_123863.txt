Mutation Operator: Modify Constant Parameters in Structs

1. Target Construct: Struct with constant parameters in generic contexts.
2. Mutation Rule:
   - Identify a struct that has constant parameters, particularly those involved in generic contexts.
   - Change the constant parameter types from a concrete lifetime like `'static` to a lifetime parameter.
   - Ensure that when modifying lifetime parameters, the struct maintains its required constraints and lifetime bounds.

3. Steps:
   a. Locate the struct definition that uses constant parameters, for example:
      `struct Inner<const A: &'static str, const N: usize>;`
   b. Change the lifetime `'static` to a generic lifetime `'a`:
      `struct Inner<'a, const N: usize>(&'a str);`
   c. If necessary, update any implementations or usages of the struct to adapt to the new lifetime parameter.
   d. Ensure that any reference to the affected type honors the new lifetime requirements.

4. Example:
   Original Code:
   ```rust
   struct Inner<const A: &'static str, const N: usize>;
   ```

   Mutated Code:
   ```rust
   struct Inner<'a, const N: usize>(&'a str);
   ```

5. Goal: This mutation operator aims to explore how the Rust compiler manages lifetime parameters in constant generic contexts, potentially exposing bugs associated with handling these elements.
