Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation

Target Structure:
Applies to trait implementations within Rust code. Specifically, this mutation focuses on altering the implementation of a trait for a specific type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation block, such as `impl<T> TraitName for TypeName`.
2. Within the implementation block, locate a type parameter constraint (e.g., `V: ?Sized`) that is not directly used or referenced in the associated types or methods of the implementation.
3. Remove the unconstrained type parameter from the implementation.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
impl<'a, V: ?Sized> Callable for &'a () {
    type Output = ();
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
impl<'a> Callable for &'a () {
    type Output = ();
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation targets unnecessary or unconstrained type parameters in trait implementations. By removing these type parameters, the mutation can expose issues in how the Rust compiler handles trait bounds and type parameter constraints, potentially triggering similar ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors) as seen in the bug report. This modification is simple yet impactful, as it directly relates to the constraints and assumptions the compiler makes during type checking and code generation processes.
