Mutation Operator: Rename Macro Identifiers and Ensure Literal Formatting

Target: Macros in Rust code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify all occurrences of macros in the code, specifically focusing on the macro_rules! syntax.
2. Within each macro, locate any identifiers that are used in the macro definition, such as `$crate`, `$ty`, and `$fmt`.
3. For each identifier that is used as a prefix or as part of a path, especially within type expressions or function signatures, ensure it is correctly formatted. This includes checking for any misspelled or unknown prefixes that could lead to internal compiler errors (ICE).
4. Rename the identifiers where necessary to ensure that they follow correct naming conventions and do not include any unknown prefixes.
5. For any literal that appears similar to a prefix but should be a string, ensure it is enclosed in double quotes.

Example:
Original macro snippet:
```rust
macro_rules! TrivialTypeTraversalImpls {
    () => {
        impl<'tcx> $crate::ty::fold::<$crate::ty::TyCtxt<'tcx>> for $ty {
            fn <F: $crate::ty::fold::<$crate::ty::TyCtxtty'format_args>>> -> ::std::result::Result<Self, F::Error>
        }
    };
}
```
Mutation steps:
- Check the identifier `$crate::ty::TyCtxtty` for correct formatting.
- Rename the identifier to use a known prefix, such as `$crate::ty::TyCtxt`.
- Ensure that any intended string literals are properly enclosed in quotes.

Resulting macro snippet:
```rust
macro_rules! TrivialTypeTraversalImpls {
    () => {
        impl<'tcx> $crate::ty::fold::<$crate::ty::TyCtxt<'tcx>> for $ty {
            fn <F: $crate::ty::fold::<$crate::ty::TyCtxt<'tcx>>> -> ::std::result::Result<Self, F::Error>
        }
    };
}
```
By addressing incorrect prefixes and ensuring literal formatting, this mutation operator helps prevent ICE scenarios related to macro processing in the Rust compiler.
