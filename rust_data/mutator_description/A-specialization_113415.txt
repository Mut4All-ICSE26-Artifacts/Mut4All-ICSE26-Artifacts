Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation with Associated Type

- Target: Trait implementation involving associated types.

- Mutation Rule: 

  1. Identify a trait with an associated type in the seed program, such as `trait TraitName { type AssociatedType; }`.

  2. Locate an implementation of this trait for a specific type, which includes a concrete type assignment for the associated type, like `impl TraitName for SomeType { type AssociatedType = ConcreteType; }`.

  3. Introduce a new trait implementation for a different type, using the existing associated type but with an unresolved or recursive type expression that references itself or another trait's associated type indirectly. 

  4. Ensure that the new implementation does not have a direct resolution path for its associated type, causing ambiguity or recursion.

- Example Pseudo-code:

  - Given the seed program snippet:
    ```
    trait MyTrait {
        type Associated;
    }

    impl MyTrait for u16 {
        type Associated = u8;
    }
    ```

  - Apply the mutation:
    ```
    impl MyTrait for i32 {
        type Associated = <i32 as AnotherTrait>::AnotherAssociated;
    }

    trait AnotherTrait {
        type AnotherAssociated;
    }

    impl AnotherTrait for i32 {
        type AnotherAssociated = <i32 as MyTrait>::Associated;
    }
    ```

- This mutation aims to create a situation where the type system faces a recursive or conflicting associated type resolution, which might lead to compiler crashes or unexpected behavior, especially with the use of specialization features.
