Mutation Operator 1: Invalid Method Call on Non-ADT

Target: This mutation operator applies to arrays, tuples, or other non-ADT (Algebraic Data Type) constructs in Rust code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing array, tuple, or other non-ADT construct within the code. For example, locate a declaration like `let arr = [1, 2, 3];` or `let tuple = (1, 2);`.
2. Insert an invalid method call using the dot operator on this non-ADT construct. Ensure that the method being called does not exist for the type of the construct.
3. Example: Transform the valid reference `let arr = [1, 2, 3];` into a mutated form by appending `.invalid_method();` resulting in `arr.invalid_method();`.

Explanation:
This mutation deliberately introduces a method call on a type that does not support it, which is a common source of compiler errors or panics. The goal is to test the compiler's ability to handle erroneous method invocations on types that do not have the expected structure or methods. Using existing constructs ensures the mutation is applicable to a wide range of codebases and can potentially uncover weaknesses in the const-eval phase and error handling mechanisms of the Rust compiler.
