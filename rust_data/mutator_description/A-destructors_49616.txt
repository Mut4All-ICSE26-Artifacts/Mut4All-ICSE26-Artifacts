Mutation Operator: Modify Usage of RefCell with Mutation on Borrow Scope

Step-by-step Instructions:

1. Identify the usage of `RefCell` in the seed program. Locate the code block where borrowing and mutation of `RefCell` contents occur.

2. Apply Mutation: Replace the `borrow_mut()` function call with `borrow()` to enforce an immutable borrow. This will likely conflict if there are mutable borrows expected, leading to potential ICE (Internal Compiler Error).

3. Example Change:
   Original:
   ```
   let s = RefCell::new(Some(10));
   if let Some(n) = *(s.borrow_mut()) {
       println!("num: {}", n);
   }
   ```
   Mutated:
   ```
   let s = RefCell::new(Some(10));
   if let Some(n) = *(s.borrow()) {
       println!("num: {}", n);
   }
   ```

4. Note: This mutation operator targets situations where mutable data is accessed through a `RefCell`, triggering potential conflicts when the borrow type is changed from mutable to immutable within the scope of the operation.

5. Applicability: This mutation can be applied to any code block where `RefCell` is used to wrap types and both `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` are invoked. It encourages testing the robustness of borrow checking when changing the type of borrow operation, particularly under the scope of NLL (Non-Lexical Lifetimes).
