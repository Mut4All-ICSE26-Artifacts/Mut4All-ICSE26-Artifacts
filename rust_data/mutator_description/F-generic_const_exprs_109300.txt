Mutation Operator: Incorrect Generic Constraint for Trait Implementation

Target Construct: This mutation targets trait implementations, specifically focusing on the generic constraints used in the implementation.

Mutation Rule:
- Identify a trait implementation in the codebase.
- Locate the generic parameters and constraints for the trait. For instance, if you have `impl<T: TraitName>`, focus on the constraint part.
- Modify the constraint to use an invalid or incomplete type expression, specifically introducing a constant expression that is not meaningful or syntactically correct in the context of the trait requirement.
  
Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a trait that is being implemented in the program. For example:
   ```
   trait ExampleTrait<T> {
       fn example_fn(&self);
   }
   ```

2. Locate an implementation of this trait. For example:
   ```
   impl<T: SomeTrait> ExampleTrait<T> for SomeType {
       fn example_fn(&self) {
           // Function body
       }
   }
   ```

3. Modify the generic constraint to use an invalid constant expression. For instance, change `T: SomeTrait` to `T: AnotherTrait<U<42>>` where `U<42>` is an invalid constraint contextually, similar to `U<1i32> = ()` in the original bug report.
   ```
   impl<T: AnotherTrait<U<42>>> ExampleTrait<T> for SomeType {
       fn example_fn(&self) {
           // Function body
       }
   }
   ```

By creating an invalid or non-type expression within the generic constraints, this mutation aims to exploit the parts of the compiler that deal with trait constraints and type resolution, potentially triggering similar internal errors as seen in the bug report.
