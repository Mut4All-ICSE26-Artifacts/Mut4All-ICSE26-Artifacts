Mutation Operator: Lifetime Parameter Mutation

Target: Struct Declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct declaration in the Rust program. This struct should have at least one lifetime parameter.

2. Choose one of the existing lifetime parameters in the struct. If the struct does not have a lifetime parameter, introduce a new one with a generic name, such as `'t`.

3. Modify the chosen or newly introduced lifetime parameter to use a reserved or undefined lifetime name like `'static` or `'undefined_lifetime`. 

4. If a new lifetime parameter was introduced in step 2, ensure that this lifetime is also used in at least one associated item of the struct, such as a field type, method signature, or implementation block.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
struct Container<'a> {
    value: &'a str,
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
struct Container<'static> {
    value: &'static str,
}
```

Note: The mutation operator specifically uses the reserved name `'static`, which is guaranteed to trigger errors related to invalid lifetime names, thus increasing the likelihood of revealing bugs associated with lifetime handling in the compiler.
