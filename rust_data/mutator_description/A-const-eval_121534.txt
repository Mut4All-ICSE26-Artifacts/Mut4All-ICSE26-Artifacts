Mutation Operator: Undefined Binary Operation in Unsafe Block

Target Construct: Function body, specifically within unsafe blocks, involving arithmetic operations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing arithmetic operation within an unsafe block. This operation can be addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
2. Alter the arithmetic operation to include operands of incompatible or undefined types within Rust's type system, such as mixing a floating-point type (f32 or f64) with an integer type (i32 or u32).
3. Ensure that the types used in the modified operation are not directly convertible or do not have a defined binary operation in Rust.
4. Use existing variables or introduce new variables with the required types. If introducing new variables, declare them explicitly with a specific type.

Example Pseudo-code:
- Original Code:
  ```
  let a = unsafe { some_union.i32_field };
  let b = unsafe { other_union.u32_field };
  let result = a + b;
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```
  let a = unsafe { some_union.i32_field };
  let c = 3.14; // Introduce a new variable with a floating-point type
  let result = a + c; // Modify the operation to include incompatible types
  ```

This mutation operator is designed to potentially expose issues in the Rust compiler's handling of undefined or unexpected type operations, especially within unsafe blocks where type safety guarantees are relaxed.
