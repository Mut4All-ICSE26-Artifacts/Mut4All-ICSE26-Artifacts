Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Function Signature for Async Functions

Target Construct: Trait function signature

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any trait that has an async function, especially those using associated type bounds or unboxed closures.
2. Change the return type of the async function to use a more generic type.
3. Replace any specific associated types with a placeholder type parameter if the trait function is using features like `associated_type_bounds` or `unboxed_closures`.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the trait with an async function. For example:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait Trait<Arg0>
where
    Arg0: ?Sized,
{
    type Return;

    async fn func(&mut self, arg0: &Arg0) -> Self::Return;
}
```

- Modify the return type of the async function. Replace `Self::Return` with a more generic type such as `impl Future<Output = Self::Return>`:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait Trait<Arg0>
where
    Arg0: ?Sized,
{
    type Return;

    async fn func(&mut self, arg0: &Arg0) -> impl Future<Output = Self::Return>;
}
```

- Ensure that any occurrence of `Self::Return` within the trait function references or implementations is updated to reflect the new type change.

Example Pseudo-code Post-Mutation:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait Trait<Arg0>
where
    Arg0: ?Sized,
{
    type Return;

    async fn func(&mut self, arg0: &Arg0) -> impl Future<Output = Self::Return>; // Changed to use impl Future
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets a common pattern in Rust's async functions that utilize traits. The mutation involves altering the return type of an async trait function to a more generic form using `impl Future`. This kind of change can stress test the compiler's type inference and trait resolution mechanisms, especially when combined with features like associated type bounds and unboxed closures, potentially exposing compiler bugs related to type resolution or async function handling.
