Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Declaration within Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function within a trait implementation that is declared with the `async` keyword.
2. Add the `const` keyword before the `async` keyword in the function declaration.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl MyTrait for SomeType {
    async fn example_function(&self) {
        // function body
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
impl MyTrait for SomeType {
    const async fn example_function(&self) {
        // function body
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets functions declared with `async` within trait implementations. By introducing the `const` keyword before `async`, it attempts to create a scenario that can trigger potential Rust compiler bugs related to incompatible combinations of `const` and `async` in this context, as seen in the provided bug report. This mutation is likely to result in compilation errors or unexpected behavior within the compiler, due to the constraint that functions in trait implementations cannot be `const`.
