Mutation Operator:

Target: Macros and Thread-Local Statics

Description: This mutation operator targets code that uses thread-local storage within macros. The aim is to transform how thread-local variables are initialized and accessed, as changes in this pattern are likely to expose edge cases in the compiler's handling of type checks and macro expansion.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a macro in the seed program that uses thread-local storage similar to `thread_local! { ... }`.
2. Identify the initialization of a thread-local static variable within this macro.
3. Introduce an additional complex initialization block within the macro that uses the existing or newly declared variable, ensuring it involves a conditional logic statement. This tests the compiler's handling of conditional expressions in thread-local contexts.

Example Mutation:
Original:
```rust
thread_local! {
    static FOO: Type = Type::new();
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
thread_local! {
    static FOO: Type = {
        let x = Type::new();
        if condition() { // Use an existing function or replace with `true` for simplicity
            x.modify();
        }
        x
    };
}
```

Explanation:
- The operator modifies the initialization of a thread-local variable `FOO` by wrapping the initializer in a conditional block. This block makes use of an existing function `condition()` to decide the initialization path.
- The mutation primarily tests the compiler's ability to generate correct code for thread-local variables with complex initialization scenarios, especially within macros.
