Mutation Operator: Transmute with Unresolved Inference

Target Construct: Transmute function usage within expressions, particularly inside let bindings or constant evaluations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing `transmute` usage within the code. The `transmute` function should be called with a structure or function that has unresolved type inference variables, such as `Option<_>`.
2. Modify the `transmute` argument to involve a more explicit operation that leads to unresolved inference. For example, use a closure or function that captures ambiguous or generic types.
3. Ensure that the argument maintains a structure that is only partially defined or involves generics without complete type specifications.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
fn some_function() {
    let _: [_; unsafe { std::mem::transmute(|x| x + 1) }];
}

Mutated Code:
fn some_function() {
    let _: [_; unsafe { std::mem::transmute(|o_b: Option<_>| {}) }];
}

Rationale:
This mutation operator specifically targets scenarios where type inference is necessary but the types are left unresolved or partially specified. By using closures or partially defined generics, this operator seeks to replicate conditions that may lead to internal compiler errors related to type inference and transmute operations.
