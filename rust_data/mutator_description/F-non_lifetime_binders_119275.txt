Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Constants in Function Signature

Target Construct: Function Signature involving Generics and Constant Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that uses generic parameters with constant expressions in the `where` clause.
2. Within the `where` clause, locate any generic constant expressions or constraints.
3. Modify the generic constant expressions by introducing a new constant value with the same type, ensuring it maintains syntactic correctness.
4. Ensure that if any new constants are introduced, they are declared explicitly within the function signature.

Example Mutation:
Original Function Signature:
```
fn example<const M: usize>(&self)
where
    for<const M: usize = 3, T = u32> [(); COT::BYTES]:,
{
}
```

Mutation Steps:
- Change the constant expression in the `where` clause.
- Introduce a new constant value or modify the existing one while maintaining the type and structure.

Mutated Function Signature:
```
fn example<const M: usize>(&self)
where
    for<const M: usize = 5, T = u32> [(); COT::BYTES]:,
{
}
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, the constant `3` in the `where` clause was changed to `5`. This modification tests the compiler's ability to handle different constant expressions within generic contexts. Such a mutation can reveal issues in how the compiler resolves or checks these expressions.
