Mutation Operator: Modify Struct with Generic Const Parameters

This mutation operator targets struct definitions that use const generics. It specifically deals with the modification of lifetime annotations and the usage of generic types in const parameters, which are areas prone to causing compiler issues as demonstrated by the bug report.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that has a const generic parameter in its definition.
2. Check if the const generic parameter involves a type that uses a lifetime.
3. Alter the const parameter type to ensure it directly depends on a generic lifetime parameter, which introduces complexity in lifetime resolution.
4. Ensure the const parameter references a generic type that can inadvertently break constraints due to lifetime issues.

Instructions:
- Locate a struct with a signature similar to `struct ExampleStruct<'a, const N: TypeWithLifetime>(&'a Type);`
- Modify the const parameter type to include a lifetime that does not align with the struct's declared lifetimes. 
- Change the struct definition to introduce a conflict or ambiguity with the lifetimes.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
struct ExampleStruct<'a, const N: SomeType>(&'a OtherType);
```

Mutation:
```
struct ExampleStruct<'a, const N: SomeType<'static>>(&'a OtherType);
```

Explanation:
- This transformation introduces a discrepancy between the const parameter's expected lifetime (`'static`) and the struct's generic lifetime (`'a`), increasing the chances of triggering compiler errors related to unresolved or conflicting lifetimes in const generics. This mutation leverages known compiler weaknesses in handling lifetimes within const parameters to maximize the likelihood of encountering a bug similar to the provided report.
