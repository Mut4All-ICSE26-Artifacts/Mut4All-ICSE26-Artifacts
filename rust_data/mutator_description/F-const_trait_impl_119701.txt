Mutation Operator 1:
Target: Trait Implementation

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify all implementations of traits declared in the seed program.
2. For a given trait implementation, locate the method signature that is defined in both the trait and the implementation.
3. Modify the parameter type in the implementation's method signature to a different type than that specified in the trait. The new type should be compatible but different (e.g., if the trait specifies `u8`, change it to `usize`).

Example:
Original Trait and Implementation:
```rust
trait MyTrait {
    fn compute(value: u8) -> usize;
}

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn compute(value: u8) -> usize {
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

Apply the Mutation:
```rust
impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn compute(value: usize) -> usize { // Change parameter type from `u8` to `usize`
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

This mutation is based on observing that discrepancies between trait declarations and their implementations can lead to type errors and potentially trigger internal compiler errors if not handled correctly by the compiler.
