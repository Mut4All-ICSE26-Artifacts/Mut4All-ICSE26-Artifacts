Mutation Operator: Modify Function Signatures with Invalid Self Parameter

Target: This mutation operator targets function signatures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Select a function signature in the seed Rust program that does not belong to an `impl` block or a trait definition.
2. Add a `&self` parameter to the function signature. This creates a semantic error since `&self` is only valid within associated functions in `impl` blocks or trait definitions.
3. Ensure the rest of the function remains unchanged to isolate the mutation to just the signature.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn calculate(value: i32) -> i32 {
    value + 10
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn calculate(&self, value: i32) -> i32 {
    value + 10
}
```

Rationale: This mutation targets the introduction of an invalid `self` parameter, which is likely to trigger the kind of compiler errors seen in the provided bug report, specifically in non-associated function contexts. This is a straightforward mutation that can be easily applied to many functions in a seed program, thereby maximizing coverage and potential for uncovering similar compiler issues.
