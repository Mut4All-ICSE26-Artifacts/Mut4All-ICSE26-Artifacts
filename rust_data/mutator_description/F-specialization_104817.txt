Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds and Implementations

Target: Trait implementation and trait bounds within the impl block.

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator focuses on altering trait bounds in trait implementations to explore potential compiler bugs related to specialization and type-checking.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a trait implementation in the seed program. In the provided code, this is an implementation of the trait `AnotherTrait` for `OpaqueType`.

2. Modify the trait implementation by adding a conflicting or redundant trait bound. Specifically, change the existing trait implementation by adding another trait bound that is not necessary or might conflict with existing ones. For instance, if the trait is implemented with a bound `T: Send`, add a redundant bound like `T: Sync`.

3. Example Pseudo-code before mutation:
   ```
   impl<T: Send> AnotherTrait for T {}
   impl AnotherTrait for OpaqueType {}
   ```

4. Example Pseudo-code after mutation:
   ```
   impl<T: Send + Sync> AnotherTrait for T {}
   impl AnotherTrait for OpaqueType {}
   ```

5. The mutation should not introduce new elements unless necessary. If new elements are introduced, clearly declare them as part of the step. In this example, no new elements are introduced, only existing trait bounds are modified.

6. Ensure the mutation is applied to various trait implementations within the code to maximize coverage and expose potential issues related to trait specialization and bounds checking.

This operator is designed to exploit potential issues within the Rust compiler's handling of trait bounds and specialization, which are known complex areas that can lead to internal compiler errors (ICE) during type-checking and monomorphization.
