Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Invocation with Expression Inside Path

Target: Macro invocation using a path with an embedded block or expression.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify macro invocations where a path is specified as a pattern and includes an embedded block or expression.
2. Modify the macro invocation by introducing a different, valid Rust path instead of the embedded block or expression.
3. Ensure that the replacement path is a valid item or path that does not include any expressions or blocks.

Example:
- Original Code:
  ```rust
  macro_rules! m {
      ($attr_path: path) => {
          #[$attr_path]
          fn f() {}
      }
  }

  m!(inline<{
      let a = CharCharFloat { a: 1 };
      println!("a: {}", a);
  }>);
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```rust
  macro_rules! m {
      ($attr_path: path) => {
          #[$attr_path]
          fn f() {}
      }
  }

  m!(inline::SomeValidPath);
  ```

Application Note: The replacement path should refer to an existing or easily declared path in the program context, ensuring that it aligns with the expectations of the macro being used. This approach generalizes testing for path-related macro invocations and avoids embedding expressions that may lead to ambiguous scenarios in macro resolution.
