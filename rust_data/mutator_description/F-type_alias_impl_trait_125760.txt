Mutation Operator 1: Modify Const Generic Parameters in Async Functions

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator is designed to target async functions with const generic parameters. It applies specifically when these generic parameters reference a type alias with `impl Trait`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify async functions in the code that use const generic parameters.
2. Check if these const parameters refer to a type alias defined using `impl Trait`.
3. Modify the async function signature by removing the const generic parameter.
4. Ensure the body of the function is still valid after modification or modify the body accordingly to ensure it compiles.

Example Mutation Steps:
Initial:
```rust
async fn example_function<const N: AliasType>() {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutation:
1. Identify the presence of a const generic parameter in the function signature, e.g., `<const N: AliasType>`.
2. Remove the const generic parameter from the function signature:
   ```rust
   async fn example_function() {
       // Adjusted function body, if necessary
   }
   ```
3. Verify that the function body does not depend on the removed parameter or make necessary adjustments.

Rationale:
This mutation operator targets the interaction between const generics and type aliasing with `impl Trait`, which is known to cause issues in the Rust compiler due to complexity in type inference and checking. By removing the const generic parameter, we potentially expose areas where the compiler's handling of these constructs could lead to internal errors or unexpected behavior. This operator also ensures that the remaining code structure is still valid, offering a high likelihood of triggering edge cases in the compiler's type-checking logic.
