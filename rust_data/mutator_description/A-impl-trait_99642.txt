Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bound in Function Return Type

- Target: Function return type utilizing `impl Trait`.
- Mutation Rule:
  1. Identify a function that returns an `impl Trait`, where the returned type is coerced into a trait object (e.g., `Box<dyn Trait>`).
  2. Modify the trait bound of the `impl Trait` to introduce a trait bound that interacts with trait object coercion, such as `impl Trait + CoerceUnsized`.
  3. Ensure the rest of the function body remains consistent with the new trait bound. This often involves ensuring that the returned type can fulfill the new trait bound, though the intention here is to intentionally cause a mismatch.
- Example:
  Original Code:
  ```
  fn example_function() -> impl Iterator<Item = impl Sized> {
      Box::new(1..) as Box<dyn Iterator<Item = _>>
  }
  ```
  Mutated Code:
  ```
  fn example_function() -> impl Iterator<Item = impl Sized + CoerceUnsized> {
      Box::new(1..) as Box<dyn Iterator<Item = _>>
  }
  ```

This mutation specifically targets the interaction between `impl Trait` and trait objects, which is a common area where internal compiler errors can occur, as suggested by the bug report involving coercion and trait bounds.
