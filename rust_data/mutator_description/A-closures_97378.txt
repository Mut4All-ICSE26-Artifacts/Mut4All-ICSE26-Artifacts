Mutation Operator

Target: Enum Destructuring in Async Blocks

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an async function containing an enum destructuring pattern inside an async block.
2. Introduce additional enum variants with fields of different types, ensuring at least one variant has a field type different from the original.
3. Modify the destructuring pattern to include a wildcard pattern (`_`) for the field, irrespective of the specific enum variant being destructured. This will ensure the pattern is always valid regardless of the enum variant passed.

Example:

Seed Program (Before Mutation):
```
pub enum Request {
    Resolve {
        url: String,
    },
}

pub async fn handle_event(
    event: Request,
)  {
    async move {
        let Request::Resolve { url } = event;
    }.await;
}
```

Mutated Program (After Mutation):
```
pub enum Request {
    Resolve {
        url: String,
    },
    OtherVariant {
        id: u32,
    },
}

pub async fn handle_event(
    event: Request,
)  {
    async move {
        let Request::Resolve { url: _ } = event;
    }.await;
}
```

This mutation introduces a new enum variant and changes the destructuring pattern to use a wildcard, potentially exposing issues in the handling of multiple enum variants within async contexts.
