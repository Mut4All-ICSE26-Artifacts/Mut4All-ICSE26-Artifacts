Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bound Expressions

Target: Trait implementations with const generics and associated trait bounds.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation that uses const generics in its trait bounds, such as `where [(); size_of::<T>()]: Sized`.
2. Alter the trait bound to use a different const expression or remove it entirely.
3. For example, change `where [(); size_of::<T>()]: Sized` to `where [(); size_of::<T>() + 1]: Sized`, or simply remove the `Sized` constraint.

Steps:
- Locate the trait implementation block. For instance, `impl<T> X<T> for Y where [(); size_of::<T>()]: Sized`.
- Modify the const expression within the `where` clause:
  a. Change the expression calculation. Example: alter `size_of::<T>()` to `size_of::<T>() + 1`.
  b. Remove the `Sized` constraint. Example: remove `where [(); size_of::<T>()]: Sized` entirely.
- Ensure the rest of the implementation remains unchanged.

This mutation operator introduces variations in the constraints related to const generics, which can lead to edge cases in the Rust compiler's handling of these features.
