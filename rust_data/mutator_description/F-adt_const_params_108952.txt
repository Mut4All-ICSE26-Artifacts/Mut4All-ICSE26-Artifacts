Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generic Parameter in Struct

Target: This mutation operator targets struct definitions with const generic parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct in the code that includes a const generic parameter. The example provided is:
   ```rust
   struct UwU<'b, const T: LifetimeGeneric>(&'b ());
   ```
2. Modify the const generic parameter by replacing the type with a non-generic one. You can transform it into a primitive type or a simple type that is already defined in the code, avoiding generics. If there's no existing simple type, introduce a simple struct or enum without generics.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the struct declaration that uses a const generic parameter type, such as `LifetimeGeneric`.
- Change the const generic parameter to a simple, specific type:
  ```rust
  // Before
  struct UwU<'b, const T: LifetimeGeneric>(&'b ());

  // After
  struct UwU<'b, const T: usize>(&'b ());
  ```
  
Explanation:
- By changing the const generic parameter from a complex type (like `LifetimeGeneric`) to a simple type (like `usize`), we are more likely to identify if the compiler's handling of generics is flawed due to its limitations with const parameter types.
- The transformation should avoid generic types with lifetimes or other const parameters, as they are prone to trigger the specific bug related to generic const parameter restriction, which this mutation is designed to investigate.
