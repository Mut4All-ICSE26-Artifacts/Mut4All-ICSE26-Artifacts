Mutation Operator: Modify Function Trait Bound to Include Additional Traits

Target Code Construct: Function Definition with Trait Bound

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program with a trait bound. For example, in the provided code, the function `call` has a trait bound on `I: Tuple`.
2. Mutate the function's trait bound to include additional traits from the standard library or custom traits defined within the program. This introduces a more complex trait requirement that might expose the Rust compiler to scenarios it doesn't handle well, especially with feature-specific traits.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the function that utilizes trait bounds. E.g., `fn call<I: Tuple>(...)`.
- Modify the trait bound to include another trait or multiple traits. Use existing traits defined in the program or standard traits for broader applicability.
- Ensure the additional trait does not conflict with existing trait bounds, unless conflict resolution is the intended mutation scenario.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn process<I: Tuple>(input: I) {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn process<I: Tuple + Clone>(input: I) {
    // function body
}
```

Explanation: In the above mutation, the `process` function's trait bound is changed from `I: Tuple` to `I: Tuple + Clone`. The addition of the `Clone` trait forces the compiler to process different trait behaviors and interactions, which may stress test its handling of complex trait compositions and potentially reveal bugs.

This mutation operator can be adapted to various functions within a Rust program, making it broadly applicable and useful for uncovering compiler issues related to trait interactions and feature-specific edge cases.
