Mutation Operator: Trait Bound Modification

Context: This mutation operator targets trait bounds in trait definitions or implementations, particularly those involving associated types and constraints.

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:
1. Identify a trait definition or implementation that involves associated types and trait bounds. For instance, locate a definition like `trait HttpService<F: Framing>: Service<S = F::F> {}`.
2. Modify the associated type constraint by introducing an additional bound or removing an existing one. This can involve altering the constraints on associated types or altering the trait hierarchy. 
3. If altering a constraint, consider changing the associated type equality to another type or adding an additional trait bound to the associated type.

Example Mutation:
- Original: `trait HttpService<F: Framing>: Service<S = F::F> {}`
- Mutated: `trait HttpService<F: Framing>: Service<S = i32> {}`

This mutation attempts to alter the expected type in the associated type definition, which can lead to type mismatches and potentially trigger errors in the type resolution within the Rust compiler.

Application:
- This operator can be applied broadly across Rust codebases where complex trait systems and associated types are utilized, potentially exposing inconsistencies or edge cases in the compiler's trait resolution logic.
