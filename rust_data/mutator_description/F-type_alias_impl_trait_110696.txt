Mutation Operator

1. Target Construct: Type Alias with `impl Trait`
2. Where it Applies: Type alias definitions using `impl Trait`, especially when related to trait implementations.
3. Mutation Rule:
   a. Identify a type alias that uses `impl Trait`, such as `type DummyT<T> = impl F;`.
   b. Alter the associated trait constraint in the type alias to a different or additional trait.
   c. For example, if a type alias currently uses `impl F`, change it to `impl F + AnotherTrait`, where `AnotherTrait` is a trait already defined in the program or suitably introduced.
   d. If necessary to introduce a new trait, declare it clearly with necessary methods but ensure it is non-standard or conflicting with existing usage.
4. Example:
   - Original: `type DummyT<T> = impl F;`
   - Mutated: `type DummyT<T> = impl F + AnotherTrait;`
   - `AnotherTrait` should be pre-declared or introduced with a clear definition such as:
     ```
     trait AnotherTrait {
         fn additional_method(&self);
     }
     ```
   - Ensure that the purpose of introducing `AnotherTrait` is clear and its methods are implemented in the relevant types.
5. Purpose: This mutation induces a scenario where the type alias is forced to resolve additional trait constraints, likely leading to resolution conflicts or internal compiler errors if the trait bounds interact in unexpected ways.
