Mutation Operator 1: Modify Box Creation with Allocator

Target Code Construct: Box creation using an allocator reference in a function.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the function where a Box is being created with an allocator reference, such as `Box::new_in(value, &std::alloc::Global)`.
2. Change the allocation to use a manual allocator implementation rather than the standard one. This can involve adding a custom allocator struct and implementing the necessary traits.
3. Declare the custom allocator before the function to ensure all elements are defined.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
a. Before the function definition, declare a custom allocator struct:
   ```
   struct CustomAllocator;

   unsafe impl std::alloc::GlobalAlloc for CustomAllocator {
       unsafe fn alloc(&self, layout: std::alloc::Layout) -> *mut u8 {
           std::alloc::System.alloc(layout)
       }
       unsafe fn dealloc(&self, ptr: *mut u8, layout: std::alloc::Layout) {
           std::alloc::System.dealloc(ptr, layout)
       }
   }
   ```

b. In the function, replace the original Box creation line with the custom allocator:
   ```
   pub fn foo() -> u8 {
       *Box::new_in(0, &CustomAllocator)
   }
   ```

Note: This mutation is designed to test the behavior of the Rust compiler when handling custom allocators, possibly leading to crashes or unexpected behavior due to the interaction with non-standard allocator implementations. Ensure the custom allocator is correctly implemented to avoid undefined behavior.
