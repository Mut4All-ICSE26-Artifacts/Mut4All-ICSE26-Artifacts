Mutation Operator: Struct with `impl Trait` in Field

Target: This mutation operator targets struct definitions with fields involving `impl Trait`. The aim is to introduce `impl Trait` in a struct field and see if it triggers any compiler mishandlings or crashes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the seed program. If no struct exists, declare a new struct.
2. Select one field of the struct that currently has a concrete type, or introduce a new field if needed.
3. Change the field's type to use `impl Trait`, where `Trait` is a trait already in use within the seed program.
4. Ensure that the trait selected is compatible with the intended usage for the struct, but do not implement it explicitly for any types within the struct.

Pseudo-code Example:

```rust
// Step 1: Identify or introduce a struct
struct Example {
    field1: i32,
    // Step 2 & 3: Change a field type to use `impl Trait`
    field2: impl Display,
    // Alternatively, introduce a completely new field using `impl Trait`
    // new_field: impl SomeTrait, // Ensure 'SomeTrait' is a trait used in the seed program
}

// Ensure no explicit implementation of the trait for types within the struct
```

Notes:
- This mutation operator can be applied to any struct within the program, making it widely adaptable.
- Care must be taken to ensure there are no explicit implementations of the trait for the types used in the `impl Trait` fields within the struct itself, aiming to trigger the compiler's handling of trait bounds and associated types.
