Mutation Operator: Alter Closure Structure

Target: Closures with unsafe blocks

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a closure in the seed program that contains an unsafe block.
2. Modify the structure of the closure to enclose the unsafe block with incorrect syntax, such as:
   - Moving the unsafe block outside the closure's body.
   - Misplacing closure delimiters `{}` within the unsafe block.
3. Ensure the closure still takes parameters and is invoked within a function, resembling the original structure to maintain context.
4. Example modification in pseudo-code form:
   Original:
   ```
   let c = |a, b| unsafe {
       // unsafe operations
   };
   ```
   Mutated:
   ```
   let c = { |a, b| unsafe }
   { 
       // unsafe operations 
   };
   ```
5. Validate that no new variables or types are introduced beyond restructuring the closure, ensuring universality across different seed programs.

This mutation operator leverages misplaced brace syntax and incorrect closure syntax to exploit potential compiler handling issues with closures involving unsafe code and parameter binding.
