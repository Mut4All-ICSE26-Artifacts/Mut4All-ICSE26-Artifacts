Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Calls
Applicable Context: This mutation targets function calls in any Rust code that utilizes async await syntax or calls functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function call in your Rust code that is either standalone or part of another expression. For example, find a function call like `foo()` or `some_function(x, y)`.

2. Modify the function call by appending `.await{}` to it, regardless of whether the function is async or not. This syntax will be invalid but could trigger issues in the parser.

3. Specifically, change:
   - From: `foo()`
   - To: `foo().await{}`

4. Ensure that the mutated code still compiles in terms of syntax but introduces an incorrect usage pattern for await expressions.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let result = foo();
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn main() {
    let result = foo().await{};
}
```

Note: This mutation applies to any Rust code with function calls, aiming to introduce erroneous await usage to test the robustness of the parser and potentially trigger compiler bugs related to async-await syntax handling.
