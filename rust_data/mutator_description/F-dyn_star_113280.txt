Mutation Operator:

Target: Function return type and cast operation in function body.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify functions that return a dynamically-sized trait object using a new feature like `dyn*`.
2. Change the return type from a dynamically-sized trait object (`dyn* Trait`) to a concrete type, preferably a type related to the original operations within the function.
3. In the function body, replace any cast operations to `dyn* Trait` with a cast to the new concrete type.

Example Mutation:

Before Mutation:
```
fn make_dyn_star<'a>(t: impl PointerLike + Debug + 'a) -> dyn* Debug + 'a {
    f32::from_bits(0x1) as f64
}
```

After Mutation:
```
fn make_dyn_star<'a>(t: impl PointerLike + Debug + 'a) -> f64 {
    f32::from_bits(0x1) as f64
}
```

Explanation:
- The mutation targets the function `make_dyn_star`.
- The return type `dyn* Debug + 'a` is replaced with the concrete type `f64`, which is compatible with the cast operation within the function body.
- Cast operations to `dyn* Trait` are removed or replaced based on compatibility with the new return type.
