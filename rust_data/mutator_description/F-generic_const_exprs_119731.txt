Mutation Operator: Modify Function Return Type to Constant Expression

This mutation operator targets functions within Rust code, specifically altering their return type to be a constant expression. This mutation is applicable within the function signature of any existing function in the seed program. It is aimed at exploiting issues related to constant evaluation in the Rust compiler.

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:

1. Identify a function in the seed program with a return type that is not a constant expression. For example:

   ```rust
   pub fn example_function() -> SomeType {
       // function body
   }
   ```

2. Modify the return type of the function to a constant expression that depends on a given constant value. For example, change `SomeType` to a constant array type using existing constants in the program:

   ```rust
   pub fn example_function() -> [usize; CONSTANT] {
       // function body
   }
   ```

3. If there isn't a suitable constant available in the program, declare a new constant of appropriate type before the function:

   ```rust
   const NEW_CONSTANT: usize = 128; // Replace with a desired constant value

   pub fn example_function() -> [usize; NEW_CONSTANT] {
       // function body
   }
   ```

4. Ensure that the function body is consistent with the new return type, either by adjusting the logic or returning a value conforming to the new type.

By altering the function's return type to a constant expression, this mutation operator tests the Rust compiler's ability to handle constant evaluation in generic contexts, potentially triggering bugs related to constant expressions.
