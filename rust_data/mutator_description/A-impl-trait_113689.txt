Mutation Operator: Manipulate Function Return Type with `impl Trait`

Target Code Construct: Function Declaration with `impl Trait` in the return type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the code where the return type is an `impl Trait`. For example, a function like:
   ```rust
   fn example_function() -> impl TraitType {
       // Function body
   }
   ```

2. Modify the function body to contain a recursive call to itself that matches the function signature's expected parameters. Ensure that this call is logically reachable.

3. If necessary, adjust the function's parameters to allow the recursive call. The recursion should conform to the function's original signature.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
fn returns_value(_: impl Fn() -> u8) {}
fn sample() -> impl Sized {
    returns_value(sample);
    10u8
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
fn returns_value(_: impl Fn() -> u8) {}
fn sample() -> impl Sized {
    returns_value(sample);
    sample(); // Recursive call added
}
```

This operator targets the use of `impl Trait` in return positions, combined with recursive calls, which can stress the compiler's trait resolution logic. This mutation can potentially expose issues in how the compiler handles trait projection and opaque types in recursive contexts.
