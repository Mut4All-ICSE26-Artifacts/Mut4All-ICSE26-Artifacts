Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds in Function Definitions

Target: Function Definitions within Implementations

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function within an `impl` block that has a `where` clause specifying a trait bound.
2. Introduce a new function within the same `impl` block, similar to the identified function.
3. In the new function, modify the `where` clause such that it introduces additional complex trait bounds that are unlikely to be satisfied.
4. Use existing types and traits within the seed program for the new trait bound, ensuring the new trait bound is more restrictive or conflicts with existing implementations.

Example Pseudo-code:

Original Function:
```rust
fn unsatisfied(self) where T: Bar<N> {}
```

Mutated Function:
```rust
fn unsatisfied_complex(self) where T: Bar<N> + AnotherTrait<M> {}
```

Explanation:
- The original function `unsatisfied` has a trait bound `T: Bar<N>`.
- A new function `unsatisfied_complex` is introduced that adds another trait bound `T: Bar<N> + AnotherTrait<M>`.
- This additional trait bound `AnotherTrait<M>` uses an existing trait or introduces one in the program, potentially leading to a scenario where the trait bound is unsatisfiable, thus exploring paths more likely to cause the Rust compiler to encounter issues similar to the bug report context.
