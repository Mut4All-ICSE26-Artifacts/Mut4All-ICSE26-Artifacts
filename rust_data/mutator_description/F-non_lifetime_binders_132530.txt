Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bounds in Function Returns

Target: Function definitions, specifically those that return `impl Trait` types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that returns a type using `impl Trait`, such as `fn produce() -> impl Trait<X>`.
2. Introduce an additional type parameter in the trait bound within the return type. For example, if the original return type is `impl Trait<X>`, change it to something more complex like `impl for<T> Trait<X, Assoc = impl Trait<T>>`.
3. Ensure that the new type parameter (`T` in this case) is correctly scoped and does not originate from an undeclared source. It’s generally recommended to use a generic parameter that is part of the function's signature or the trait, or to introduce it in a `for<T>` clause as shown in the example.
4. If you introduce a new type parameter, ensure that it doesn’t conflict with existing ones and maintain consistency in type constraints.
5. The new trait bound should maintain the same semantic intent but introduce complexity that could potentially expose canonization or type inference issues in the compiler.

Example:
Original Function:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl SomeTrait<Type> {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated Function:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl for<T> SomeTrait<Type, Assoc = impl SomeTrait<T>> {
    // function body
}
```

This mutation operator focuses on expanding the trait bounds using the `for<T>` syntax and adding an `Assoc` type that is a complex trait itself. This often stretches the compiler's type inference and canonicalization logic, potentially uncovering issues similar to the one reported in the bug.
