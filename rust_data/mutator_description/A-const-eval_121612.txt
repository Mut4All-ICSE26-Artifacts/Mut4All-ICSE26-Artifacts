Mutation Operator: Modify Const Initialization with Trait Bound Violation

Target Code Construct: Const Initializations involving Trait Bound Structures

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a const initialization that utilizes a struct or type alias with a specific trait bound, for example, `const MY_CONST: &MyType = &MyType(value);`.
2. Check if there is a trait bound in the structure that limits the types or operations.
3. Mutate the const initialization by assigning a value that does not satisfy the trait bound.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
trait Trait {}
impl Trait for bool {}
struct MyType<T: Trait>(bool, T);
const MY_CONST: &MyType = &MyType(true, false);
```

Mutated:
```
trait Trait {}
impl Trait for bool {}
struct MyType<T: Trait>(bool, T);
const MY_CONST: &MyType = &MyType(true, 42); // Assuming `42` does not implement `Trait`
```

Explanation:
The mutation modifies the value assigned in the const initialization to one that violates the trait bound condition, which could trigger an internal compiler error in type handling during const evaluation. The mutation maintains the structure of the code but changes the initialization values to induce unexpected behaviors in the compiler, focusing on areas where type constraints are enforced.
