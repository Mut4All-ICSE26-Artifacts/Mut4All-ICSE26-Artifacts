Mutation Operator: Modify Generator Trait and Box Usage

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets the `impl GeneratorProviderAlt` for the unit type `()` and specifically modifies the usage of `Box` inside the `Context` struct, as well as the generator's yield behavior within the `start` function.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the `Context<G>` struct declaration in the seed program. Identify the field that uses `Box<G::Gen>`.
2. Change the `Box<G::Gen>` to `Option<Box<G::Gen>>`, introducing a level of indirection.
3. Ensure the `start` function in the `impl GeneratorProviderAlt` for `()` is adapted to handle the `Option` type. Add logic to check for `Some` and `None` variants.
4. Adjust the generator logic such that the `yield` statement now depends on the presence of the `Option` being `Some`.

Example Steps:
- Original `Context` struct:
  ```rust
  pub struct Context<G: 'static + GeneratorProviderAlt> {
      link: Box<G::Gen>,
  }
  ```
- Mutated `Context` struct:
  ```rust
  pub struct Context<G: 'static + GeneratorProviderAlt> {
      link: Option<Box<G::Gen>>,
  }
  ```
- Original `start` function:
  ```rust
  fn start(ctx: Context<Self>) -> Self::Gen {
      move || {
          match ctx { _ => () }
          yield ();
      }
  }
  ```
- Mutated `start` function:
  ```rust
  fn start(ctx: Context<Self>) -> Self::Gen {
      move || {
          if let Some(gen) = ctx.link {
              yield ();
          } else {
              // Handle None case, perhaps by logging or returning early
          }
      }
  }
  ```

This mutation operator leverages the introduction of `Option` to modify the control flow and state checking, aiming to test how the Rust compiler handles more complex generator states and possible nullability scenarios.
