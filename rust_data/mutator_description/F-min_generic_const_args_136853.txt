Mutation Operator: Modify Function Usage in Const Context

Target: Functions used within const contexts or constant expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function call within a constant expression or a context that expects a constant value. For example, within an array index or a const parameter.
2. Change the function call to use a type or expression that is not permitted in the constant context. For example, use a function or a random variable as an index or argument instead.
3. Ensure that the existing function or variable from the seed program is used if applicable. If a new function or variable is necessary, declare it explicitly with a simple structure.

Example:
Original Code:
```
const fn_value = some_function();
let _ = [1, 2, 3][fn_value];
```

Mutation:
1. Replace `fn_value` with a direct function call or a variable that is not constant, e.g., `some_function()` or `let local_variable = 5;`.
```
const fn_value = some_function(); 
let _ = [1, 2, 3][some_function()];
```

or

```
let local_variable = 5;
let _ = [1, 2, 3][local_variable];
```

This mutation exploits the incorrect use of non-constant values in contexts that require const arguments, such as array indexing or const parameters, increasing the likelihood of triggering a compiler bug related to constant evaluation.
