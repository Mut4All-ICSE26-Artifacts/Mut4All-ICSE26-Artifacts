Mutation Operator: Modify Const Function to In-line Closure

Target: This mutation operator targets `const fn` declarations that return closures, specifically modifying how the closure is inlined within the code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `const fn` that returns a closure, such as:
   ```rust
   const CONST_FN: fn() = || { some_statements; };
   ```

2. Convert the closure to be directly inlined within the function that utilizes it. This involves:
   - Removing the `const fn` declaration.
   - Inlining the closure directly at the point of use.
   - Ensure that the closure's body is written explicitly within the function that uses it, rather than being referenced through a constant function.

3. Example Conversion:
   - Original:
     ```rust
     const CONST_FN: fn() = || { perform_action(); };

     fn example_function() {
         let _var = &CONST_FN;
     }
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```rust
     fn example_function() {
         let _var = || { perform_action(); };
     }
     ```

4. Ensure that the mutated function preserves the original logic and variable scopes.

5. Test the mutation by compiling with optimization and incremental compilation enabled to observe if similar compiler issues are triggered.
