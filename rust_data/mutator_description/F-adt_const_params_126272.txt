Mutation Operator: Modify Struct Fields in const Context

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets struct definitions that are used as constant parameters within a const context, specifically those structures that are marked with the `ConstParamTy` trait.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that is implementing the `ConstParamTy` trait and is used as a constant generic parameter.
2. Modify the type of one of the fields in the struct to another type that is compatible with the operations being performed but may result in different behaviors.
3. Ensure that the change does not introduce direct compile-time errors unrelated to the const param usage to maintain the focus on the const parameter evaluation.

Example:
Original Struct Definition:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, ConstParamTy)]
struct Foo {
    value: i32,
    nested: &'static Bar<std::fmt::Debug>,
}
```

Mutation Applied:
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, ConstParamTy)]
struct Foo {
    value: u32, // Changed from i32 to u32
    nested: &'static Bar<std::fmt::Debug>,
}
```

Explanation:
- The field `value` in the struct `Foo` is originally of type `i32`. The mutation changes its type to `u32`.
- This type change is subtle because both `i32` and `u32` are integer types; however, they can cause different behaviors in constant evaluation due to differences in signedness and size in cases involving arithmetic or comparisons.
- This change is particularly chosen to maintain compatibility while potentially triggering compiler behavior differences due to the nature of how the constant evaluations are done with the `adt_const_params` feature.
