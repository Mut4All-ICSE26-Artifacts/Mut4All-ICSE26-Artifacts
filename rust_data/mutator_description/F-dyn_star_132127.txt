Mutation Operator: Alter Trait Bounds in Type Casting

Target Construct: Trait Bounds in Type Casting

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any type casting expressions involving `dyn* Trait` with additional trait bounds, such as `dyn* Trait + Send`.
2. Modify the existing trait bounds by either:
   a. Adding a new trait bound that is unrelated but does not conflict with the existing bounds (e.g., add `Clone`).
   b. Removing one of the existing trait bounds, if there are multiple (e.g., remove `Send`).
   c. Replacing one of the existing bounds with a different one (e.g., replace `Send` with `Sync`).

3. Ensure that any added or replaced traits are already defined in the scope or standard library and do not lead to undeclared identifiers.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
```
fn main() {
    let x: dyn* Trait + Send = 1usize;
    x as dyn* Trait;
}
```

Mutated Code (Adding a Trait Bound):
```
fn main() {
    let x: dyn* Trait + Send + Clone = 1usize;
    x as dyn* Trait;
}
```

Mutated Code (Removing a Trait Bound):
```
fn main() {
    let x: dyn* Trait = 1usize;
    x as dyn* Trait;
}
```

Mutated Code (Replacing a Trait Bound):
```
fn main() {
    let x: dyn* Trait + Sync = 1usize;
    x as dyn* Trait;
}
```

These mutations leverage the complexity and handling of trait bounds in type casting, which can potentially trigger issues in the type checking mechanism of the Rust compiler, especially when dealing with the newer `dyn*` feature.
