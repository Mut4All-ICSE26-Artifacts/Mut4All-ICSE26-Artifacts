Mutation Operator: Replace Const Generic Parameter Type with Non-Supported Type

Target: Const generic parameters in structs, traits, and functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct, trait, or function that uses a const generic parameter with a supported type (e.g., integer, bool, char).
2. Replace the type of the const generic parameter with a non-supported type (e.g., a user-defined type or a complex type like a struct).
3. Ensure that the non-supported type is declared in the code if it is newly introduced.

Example:
Original:
```
struct Container<const N: usize>([i32; N]);
```

Mutated:
```
struct Dimension; // Declare a new user-defined type
struct Container<const N: Dimension>([i32; 10]); // Replace the type of the const generic parameter
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets the use of const generic parameters and replaces their types with non-supported types. By doing so, it aims to trigger compiler errors or crashes related to const generic parameter handling, similar to the issues described in the bug report where user-defined types used as const parameters caused ICEs and errors.
