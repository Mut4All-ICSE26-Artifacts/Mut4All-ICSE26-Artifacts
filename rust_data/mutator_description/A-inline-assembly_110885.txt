Mutation Operator: Modify Inline Assembly Directives

Target Code Construct: Inline assembly block in Rust code invoking the `global_asm!` macro.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any `global_asm!` macro invocation in the Rust source code. The macro typically includes inline assembly code, often through the use of `include_str!` to import assembly files.
2. Within the inline assembly code (or the string containing it), locate any instance of an instruction directive or mnemonic. This can be any valid or invalid assembly instruction present in the inline code.
3. Introduce a syntax error by modifying an existing valid instruction or creating a non-standard instruction mnemonic. For example, replace a known instruction mnemonic with a string that is not valid assembly syntax (`MOV` to `MOOV`, or `ADD` to `ADDD`).
4. Ensure that the mutation does not introduce undeclared variables or types, and that it remains syntactically correct in Rust terms, even if the assembly syntax is incorrect.
5. Apply the mutated assembly string back into the `global_asm!` macro, preserving the structure of the Rust code but altering the assembly instructions.

Example:
Original Assembly Statement: `MOV R0, R1`
Mutated Assembly Statement: `MOOV R0, R1`

By introducing an unrecognized assembly mnemonic, the mutation operator aims to trigger errors related to inline assembly parsing in the Rust compiler, potentially leading to internal compiler errors (ICEs) if there are undiscovered issues in the handling of inline assembly code.
