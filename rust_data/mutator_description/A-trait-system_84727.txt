Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bound in Implementation

The mutation operator targets trait implementations, specifically altering trait bounds in where clauses of impl blocks. This modification can influence trait selection and associated type resolution, which are common areas where compiler bugs occur.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an `impl` block for a trait where clause is used to constrain the types.
2. Select one of the trait bounds in the where clause. For example, if the bound is `Fg: Over<C, NewFg>`, identify this constraint.
3. Change the selected trait bound to a different constraint. For instance, you could change it to `Fg: Over<NewBg, NewFg>` or any other variation that involves types within the context.
4. Ensure that the modified bound still uses types existing in the original program's context. Avoid introducing new types unless absolutely necessary.
5. Verify that the change introduces a type discrepancy that could lead to unexpected behavior in trait resolution.

Example:
Original code snippet:
```rust
impl<C, Fg, Bg, NewFg, NewBg> Over<Color<C>, Cell<NewFg, NewBg>> for Cell<Fg, Bg>
where
    Fg: Over<C, NewFg>,
    Bg: Over<C, NewBg>,
{
    fn over(self, _: Color<C>) -> Cell<NewFg, NewBg> {
        todo!();
    }
}
```

Mutated code snippet:
```rust
impl<C, Fg, Bg, NewFg, NewBg> Over<Color<C>, Cell<NewFg, NewBg>> for Cell<Fg, Bg>
where
    Fg: Over<NewBg, NewFg>, // Changed bound
    Bg: Over<C, NewBg>,
{
    fn over(self, _: Color<C>) -> Cell<NewFg, NewBg> {
        todo!();
    }
}
```

This mutation specifically alters the trait bounds, leading to potential inconsistencies in trait implementation that the compiler might not handle correctly, thereby triggering a bug.
