Mutation Operator: Modify Function Return Type with Incomplete `impl Trait`

Target Construct: Function return types with `impl Trait`

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that returns a type using `impl Trait`.
2. Remove the specified trait after `impl`, making it an incomplete return type declaration.
3. Ensure the function body attempts to use a language feature that would normally require a complete trait specification.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    vec![1, 2, 3].into_iter()
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl {
    yield 1;
}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation operator targets the function return type using `impl Trait`, specifically removing the trait specification.
- By leaving the return type as `impl` without specifying any traits, the compiler is forced to handle an incomplete type definition.
- Additionally, including a `yield` statement in the function body, which is typically used in generators, further stresses the type-checking and coroutine handling aspects of the compiler, increasing the likelihood of triggering a bug.
- This mutation leverages existing syntax and constructs in the seed program, while introducing a minimal yet significant modification to increase the chance of uncovering potential compiler issues related to type inference and coroutine handling.
