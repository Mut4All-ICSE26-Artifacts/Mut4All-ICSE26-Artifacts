Mutation Operator: Replace Const with Custom Struct

Target Code Construct: Struct definitions with named fields and Top-level const item declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Insert a hidden tuple struct declaration HiddenStruct(i32) into the file.
2. This mutation operator identifies all top-level const items and performs the following transformations: it replaces their type with a newly introduced struct type HiddenStruct, changes their value expression to an instantiation of HiddenStruct(42), and adds the attribute #[allow(dead_code)] to suppress unused code warnings. This mutation is designed to test the compiler's handling of constant values involving user-defined types.
3. Identify all struct definitions that use named fields (i.e., { ... } form).
4. For each such struct, append a new field a: i32 to its field list.

Example:
Original:
```rust
struct Foo {
    x: u8,
}
const N: i32 = 10;
fn main() {}
```

Mutated:
```rust
struct HiddenStruct(i32);
struct Foo {
    x: u8,
    a: i32,
}
#[allow(dead_code)]
const N: HiddenStruct = HiddenStruct(42);
fn main() {}
```

This mutation operator alters type and structure definitions simultaneously. The insertion of the HiddenStruct and modification of const declarations can test the compilerâ€™s handling of custom types in constant contexts. Meanwhile, augmenting all named-field structs with a new field a: i32 may impact trait derivation, memory layout, pattern matching, or inferred lifetimes, thereby increasing the chances of triggering type system inconsistencies, layout bugs, or ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors).
