Mutation Operator

Target Construct: Trait Bound in Implementation

Applicable Context: Modify a trait implementation's bounds to induce incorrect type usage or conflicts, especially in complex type scenarios such as those involving transmutability or projections.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation where complex bounds are used, such as involving type projections or advanced types (e.g., `for<'a>` lifetimes, associated type projections).
2. Modify the bounds of this implementation to use a non-existent or incorrectly defined module or type.
3. Specifically, replace a valid type bound with a reference to a non-existent module's associated type or an undeclared type.

Example:
Starting code:
```rust
impl<T> Trait for T where T: AnotherTrait {
    type AssociatedType = T::AnotherType;
}
```

Mutation:
1. Replace `T: AnotherTrait` with `NonExistentModule::Type`, which is not declared or imported in the scope.
2. The new code should look like this:

```rust
impl<T> Trait for T where NonExistentModule::Type {
    type AssociatedType = T::AnotherType;
}
```

This mutation targets the trait's implementation block by introducing undeclared or incorrect module references, which can lead to errors related to type resolution, aiding in finding potential compiler bugs related to type checking and normalization.
