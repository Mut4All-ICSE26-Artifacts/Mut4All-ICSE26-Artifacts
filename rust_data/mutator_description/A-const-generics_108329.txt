Mutation Operator: Modify Slice Indexing with Out-of-Bounds Access

Target Construct: Function body involving array or vector indexing.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any instance of slice or vector indexing within a function. In the provided code, this is `self.buffer[..]`.
2. Change the slice indexing to attempt accessing an element out of bounds. Use an index that is clearly greater than the length of the array or vector.
3. For this mutation, replace the current slice `self.buffer[..]` with something like `self.buffer[self.buffer.len()..self.buffer.len() + 1]` to intentionally go out of bounds.

Example:
Original Code:
```
let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(self.buffer.len());
buf.copy_from_slice(self.buffer[..]);
```

Mutated Code:
```
let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(self.buffer.len());
buf.copy_from_slice(self.buffer[self.buffer.len()..self.buffer.len() + 1]);
```

This mutation operator exploits the slice boundary check to provoke a panic or error in the compiler or at runtime, intended to reveal weaknesses in the handling of index bounds.
