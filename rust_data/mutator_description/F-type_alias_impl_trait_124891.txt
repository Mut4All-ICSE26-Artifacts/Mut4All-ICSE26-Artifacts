Mutation Operator: Modify Type Alias with Trait Bound

1. Target: This mutation operator targets type aliases defined with the `impl Trait` keyword in Rust. Specifically, it modifies the type alias to include additional trait bounds.

2. Mutation Rule: 
   - Identify a type alias that uses the `impl Trait` syntax. For instance, `type Tait = impl FnOnce() -> ();`.
   - Modify the type alias by adding an additional trait bound. For example:
     - Original: `type Tait = impl FnOnce() -> ();`
     - Mutated: `type Tait = impl FnOnce() -> () + Send;`

3. Application:
   - Locate the type alias declaration in the Rust code.
   - Append a valid trait bound to the `impl Trait` expression. Ensure the trait bound is universally applicable, such as `Send` or `Sync`.

4. Example:
   - Given Seed Code:
     ```
     type Tait = impl FnOnce() -> ();
     ```
   - Apply Mutation:
     ```
     type Tait = impl FnOnce() -> () + Send;
     ```

5. Notes:
   - This mutation operator relies on the assumption that the seed program has type aliases using the `impl Trait` construct.
   - The additional trait bound must be valid for the expected type, and the mutated code should still compile if no other errors exist.
   - If the seed program contains multiple type aliases using `impl Trait`, apply the mutation to each as needed.
