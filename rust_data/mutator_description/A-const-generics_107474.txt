Mutation Operator: Modify Generic Parameter Constraints

Target: This mutation operator targets generic parameter constraints in Rust code, specifically in trait and struct declarations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a generic parameter in a struct or trait declaration that has a constraint. For instance, in the given example, "OT: Bytes" is a constraint on the generic parameter OT.
2. Modify the constraint by introducing an additional trait constraint that the generic parameter should implement.
3. If the current constraint is "OT: Bytes," change it to "OT: Bytes + AnotherTrait," where AnotherTrait is an existing trait in the seed program that OT or COT doesn't necessarily implement.
4. Ensure that the trait used in the new constraint is already part of the scope, or add a use statement if it is from a different module.
5. Example: If the seed program has a trait "Display," modify the constraint in the struct Conster and its impl block as follows:
   - Original: `OT: Bytes`
   - Mutated: `OT: Bytes + Display`

This mutation operator exploits the intricacies of trait bounds in generic parameters, which can lead to unexpected compiler behavior, especially around const-generics and associated constants.
