Mutation Operator: Alter Lifetime Annotations in Trait Implementations

Target: Trait implementations in Rust, specifically the lifetime annotations associated with trait members or associated types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the Rust code containing a trait implementation with lifetime annotations. Focus on the `impl` block of a struct implementing a trait.
2. Select the lifetime parameter declared for the implementation (e.g., `'a` in `impl<'a> Trait<'a> for Struct`).
3. Modify the lifetime by introducing a mismatch or inconsistency:
   - If a single lifetime is used consistently across the `impl` block, introduce a new lifetime parameter with a different name (e.g., `'b`) and swap it with the original one in parts of the type associated with the trait.
   - Ensure that the new lifetime parameter is not declared as part of the `impl` block but is used within the associated type declaration.

Example:
Original:
```rust
impl<'a> Trait<'a> for Struct {
    type Assoc = &'a u32;
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
impl<'a> Trait<'a> for Struct {
    type Assoc = &'b u32;  // Introduces an undeclared lifetime `'b`
}
```

By altering lifetime annotations in ways that introduce inconsistencies or mismatches, this mutation operator is designed to stress-test the Rust compiler's handling of lifetimes, potentially revealing bugs related to lifetime resolution or checking. This mutation can be applied to any trait implementation where lifetimes are used, offering wide coverage across different code bases.
