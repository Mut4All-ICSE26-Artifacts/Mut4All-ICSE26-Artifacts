Mutation Operator

Target: Function Parameter and Where Clause

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a generic function in the code that has a `where` clause associated with it, similar to the `walk2` function in the provided Rust code.
2. Within the `where` clause, locate a constraint that involves a const generic parameter, such as `for<const C: usize>`.
3. Change the type constraint of the const generic parameter from a basic type like `usize` to a more complex expression that involves another type parameter or a mix of types, potentially leading to bound or type inference issues.
4. Ensure that the new constraint still syntactically fits within the context of const generics but semantically challenges the type system.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn example_function<'a, T: 'a>(param: T)
where
    for<const C: usize> [(); C]: 'a,
{
    // Function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn example_function<'a, T: 'a>(param: T)
where
    for<const C: T::AssociatedType> [(); C + 1]: 'a,
{
    // Function body
}
```
In this mutation, `T::AssociatedType` assumes `T` has an associated type, which can introduce complications in constraints that depend on the associated type's properties, potentially triggering issues with the Rust compiler's handling of const generics and bound variables. Note that this mutation requires `T` to have an associated type, which might need to be declared if not already present in the seed program.
