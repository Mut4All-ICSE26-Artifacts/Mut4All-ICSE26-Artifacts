Mutation Operator: Async Function Await Manipulation

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets asynchronous functions (`async fn`) in Rust programs that contain the `await` keyword.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate an `async fn` that includes multiple `await` expressions in its body.
2. Identify an `await` expression that is on the left-hand side of an assignment. This expression should await a reference or mutable reference.
3. Modify the identified expression by altering the target of the `await` operation. Specifically, change the await to operate on a different field or variable that is of compatible type.
4. Ensure that the target of the assignment is consistent with the modified `await` expression.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
pub async fn commit<B: Clone>(this: &mut File<B>) {
    let file = async { &this }.await;
    *async { &mut this.block }.await = file.block.clone();
}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Identify `await` expressions: `async { &this }.await` and `async { &mut this.block }.await`.
2. Select the `await` expression: `async { &mut this.block }.await` on the left-hand side of the assignment.
3. Modify this expression to await another compatible field or variable (e.g., `this.block`).
4. Ensure the right-hand side of the assignment matches the new context.

Mutated Code:
```rust
pub async fn commit<B: Clone>(this: &mut File<B>) {
    let file = async { &this }.await;
    *async { &mut this.block }.await = this.block.clone();
}
```

Note: This mutation operator aims to explore alternative execution paths and test the compiler's handling of assignment targets involving `await` expressions.
