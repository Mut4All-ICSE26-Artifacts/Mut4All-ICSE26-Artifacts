Mutation Operator: Convert Safe Function Pointers to Unsafe

Target Code Construct: Function pointers or function types within let statements in a Rust program.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function pointer or function type declaration within a `let` statement that is declared as safe (i.e., does not include the `unsafe` keyword).
2. Modify the declaration to make it an unsafe function pointer by adding the `unsafe` keyword to the function type.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a `let` statement that declares a function pointer or function type. For example, `let foo: fn(i32, i32) = some_function;`.
- Add the `unsafe` keyword before the function type in the declaration. The mutated line should look like this: `let foo: unsafe fn(i32, i32) = some_function;`.

Example Pseudo-Code:
Original:
```
let calculate: fn(i32, i32) -> i32 = add;
```

Mutated:
```
let calculate: unsafe fn(i32, i32) -> i32 = add;
```

This mutation takes advantage of the intricacies in handling unsafe function pointers and can potentially lead to unexpected behaviors in the compiler, especially when optimizations are applied, as seen in the bug report.
