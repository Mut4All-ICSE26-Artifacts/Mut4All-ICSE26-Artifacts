Mutation Operator: Modify Specialization Constraint

1. Target Construct: Impl block of a trait.

2. Mutation Rule:
   a. Locate an impl block that specializes a trait for a generic type `T` with a constraint, such as `where T: const Specialize`.
   b. Alter the constraint to include a more complex or additional constraint that might cause resolution issues. For example, modify it to `where T: const Specialize + AnotherTrait`.

3. Example:
   Original:
   ```
   impl<T> const Foo for T where T: const Specialize {}
   ```
   
   Mutated:
   ```
   impl<T> const Foo for T where T: const Specialize + AnotherTrait {}
   ```
   - Declare `AnotherTrait` if it does not exist in the program:
     ```
     trait AnotherTrait {}
     ``` 

This mutation introduces additional complexity to the trait specialization conditions, potentially triggering resolution issues within the compiler, especially when combined with features like `min_specialization`.
