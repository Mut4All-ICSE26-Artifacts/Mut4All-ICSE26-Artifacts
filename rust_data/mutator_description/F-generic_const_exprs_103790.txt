Mutation Operator: Adjust Const Generic Parameters for Structs

Target: This mutation applies to struct definitions that use const generic parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the Rust code that contains const generic parameters.
   Example: struct MyStruct<const X: usize, const Y: X = {X}>;
   
2. Change the const generic parameters to use distinct and unique names. Ensure that each parameter has a unique name and does not refer to another parameter in its default value or constraint.
   Example Transformation:
   Original: struct MyStruct<const X: usize, const Y: X = {X}>;
   Mutated: struct MyStruct<const A: usize, const B: usize = {1}>;

3. If the struct has default values for const generics, replace these default values with constant expressions or numeric literals that do not reference other const parameters.
   
4. Ensure that the newly introduced names do not conflict with existing names in the program or within the same scope.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
struct Example<const N: usize, const M: N = {N}>;
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct Example<const A: usize, const B: usize = {0}>;
```

This mutation aims to prevent issues arising from cyclic dependencies and ambiguities in const generic parameters, which can lead to internal compiler errors (ICE) as observed in the bug report.
