Mutation Operator 1: Modify Closure Capture in Function Return Type

Target: Closure within a function returning an `impl Fn`.

Description: Closures in Rust can capture their environment. This operator will mutate the captured variable by introducing a different scope or modifying the captured variable to increase the complexity of the closure.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that returns an `impl Fn`, similar to the function `f` in the bug report.
2. Inside this function, locate the closure and the variables it captures.
3. Create an additional variable within the function, ensuring that it has a different type or a more complex structure than the currently captured variable.
4. Modify the closure to capture this new variable instead of or in addition to the original variable.
5. Ensure that the closure body references the new variable to enforce the capture.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl Fn(i32) {
    let captured_value = 10;
    move |x| x + captured_value
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
fn example_function() -> impl Fn(i32) {
    let captured_value = 10;
    let additional_value = vec![1, 2, 3]; // New variable with a different type
    move |x| {
        let _ = additional_value.len(); // Reference the new variable to ensure capture
        x + captured_value
    }
}
```

This mutation introduces a new captured variable (`additional_value`) of a different type, which can potentially trigger bugs related to closure capturing and scope handling in the Rust compiler.
