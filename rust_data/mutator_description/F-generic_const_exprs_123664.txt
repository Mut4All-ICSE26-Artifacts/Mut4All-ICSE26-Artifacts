Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Bound with Const Trait Implementation

Target: Function Definitions with Trait Bounds

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition with a trait bound that specifies a trait with a const trait implementation.
2. Locate the trait bound in the function signature, such as `F: ~const Fn()`.
3. Modify the trait bound to include a different const trait, such as `F: ~const Clone`.
4. Ensure that the function body or caller context remains valid, making use of existing variables, types, or functions.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
const fn example<F: ~const Fn()>(f: F) {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
const fn example<F: ~const Clone>(f: F) {
    // Function body
}
```

This mutation operator targets function definitions that use const trait bounds and modifies the trait to another const-compatible trait, which can potentially trigger compiler bugs related to const trait handling and resolution.
