Mutation Operator

Target Construct: Function Signature and Return Type

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that returns a result type, particularly one involving complex types or nested enums and structs.
2. Modify the return type of the function to introduce a nested or recursive result type. For instance, if the function originally returns Result<T, E>, change it to Result<Result<T, E>, E>.
3. Ensure that the function's implementation is also updated to handle this new nested return type. This may involve wrapping existing values in an additional Ok or Err layer to match the new return structure.
4. Test if the mutation introduces any unexpected behavior, particularly in the borrow-checking phase, as the nested result types can cause interactions between lifetimes or mutability rules that the compiler must handle.

Example:
Original:
fn process_data(data: &str) -> Result<Data, ProcessingError> {
    // function implementation
}

Mutated:
fn process_data(data: &str) -> Result<Result<Data, ProcessingError>, ProcessingError> {
    // updated function implementation to match the new return type
    // e.g., return Ok(Ok(data_processed)) or return Ok(Err(error))
} 

By introducing nested result types, this mutation operator aims to test the borrow checker's ability to handle complex lifetime and ownership scenarios that may lead to compiler issues.
