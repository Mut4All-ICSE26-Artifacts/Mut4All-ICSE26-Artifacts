Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Method with Conditional Branches

Target: Trait method with a match or conditional expression

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a method within a trait that contains a match expression or any conditional branching (e.g., `if`, `match`).
2. Within each branch of the match or conditional expression, introduce a temporary variable that borrows a mutable reference of `self`. This variable should be declared but unused within the same branch.
3. Ensure that the borrowed reference remains live within the scope of the branch, but does not interact with any operations within the branch.

Example:
Consider the following trait with a method containing a match expression:
```
trait Example {
    fn process(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let num = 42;
        match num {
            n if n > 10 => {
                // Original code
                println!("Number is greater than 10");
            }
            _ => {
                // Original code
                println!("Number is 10 or less");
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

After applying the mutation operator:
```
trait Example {
    fn process(&mut self) -> Result<(), String> {
        let num = 42;
        match num {
            n if n > 10 => {
                // Introduce unused mutable reference
                let _temp_ref = &mut *self;  
                println!("Number is greater than 10");
            }
            _ => {
                // Introduce unused mutable reference
                let _temp_ref = &mut *self;  
                println!("Number is 10 or less");
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

Note: This mutation introduces two-phase borrowing in each branch by declaring an unused mutable reference to `self`, which can lead to borrow checker inconsistencies or unexpected compiler behavior when multiple branches manipulate or handle mutable references.
