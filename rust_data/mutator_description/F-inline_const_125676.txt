Mutation Operator: Replace `const` Block with Inline Conditional Expression

Target Code Construct: Inline constant block within a const function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constant block (`const { ... }`) within a `const fn`.
2. Replace the `const { ... }` block with an inline conditional expression.
3. Ensure the inline conditional expression produces the same result type as expected by the surrounding context or by the function's return type.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```rust
const fn test_me<T>(a: usize, b: usize) -> usize {
    const {
        if a < b {
            std::mem::size_of::<T>()
        } else {
            usize::MAX
        }
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
const fn test_me<T>(a: usize, b: usize) -> usize {
    if a < b {
        std::mem::size_of::<T>()
    } else {
        usize::MAX
    }
}
```

Explanation:
- The inline constant block is replaced by a conditional expression directly. This mutation is likely to affect how the compiler handles constant evaluation, potentially triggering bugs related to inline constants. It removes the explicit `const` block and directly uses the conditional logic within the function. This is designed to test how the compiler optimizes and processes inline expressions in constant functions.
