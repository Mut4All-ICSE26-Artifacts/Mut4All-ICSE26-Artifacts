Mutation Operator: Modify Const Trait Implementation

Target Code Construct: Traits and Trait Implementations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that is marked with `const_trait_impl` or involves const trait methods.
2. If the trait is not marked with `#[const_trait]`, add this attribute to the trait definition.
3. Locate an implementation of the trait that is declared with `impl const`.
4. Within this implementation, ensure that:
   - At least one method does not use the `~const` keyword in its signature.
5. If the trait already has methods, add a new method with the `~const` keyword in its parameter or return type constraint.

Example Before Mutation:
```rust
#![feature(const_trait_impl)]

trait MyTrait {
    fn compute(&self) -> i32;
}

impl const MyTrait for i32 {
    fn compute(&self) -> i32 {
        *self + 1
    }
}
```

Example After Mutation:
```rust
#![feature(const_trait_impl)]

#[const_trait]
trait MyTrait {
    fn compute(&self) -> i32;
}

impl const MyTrait for i32 {
    fn compute(&self) -> i32 {
        *self + 1
    }
    
    fn new_method<A: ~const MyTrait>(&self) -> i32 {
        *self + 2
    }
}
```

Explanation: By adding the `#[const_trait]` attribute to the trait and introducing a new method with `~const` in the implementation, this mutation operator exploits the potentially unstable or incomplete handling of const traits in the Rust compiler, aiming to trigger issues related to const trait feature processing.
