Mutation Operator: Dereference of Unsupported Types

Target: Constants and statics involving reference types in Rust programs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any constant or static variable declarations in the seed program.
2. Check if the variable is declared with a type that is not a pointer, slice, or dereferenceable type (e.g., `()` or `str`).
3. Introduce a dereference operation (`*`) before an expression that is assigned to the constant or static variable.
4. Ensure that the dereference operation is applied to a type that inherently does not support dereferencing, such as a non-pointer type like `()` or `str`.

Example:
Assuming the seed program has the following constant declaration:

```rust
const VALUE: () = ();
```

Apply the mutation:

```rust
const VALUE: () = *();
```

Explanation:
This mutation aims to replicate the dereferencing of a type that cannot be dereferenced, as identified in the bug report. By attempting to dereference unsupported types, the mutation operator explores a path that often results in compilation errors or unexpected internal compiler errors (ICEs), as shown in the provided bug report. The mutated code will likely trigger a similar issue due to the inherent unsuitability of the dereferencing operation on non-pointer types.
