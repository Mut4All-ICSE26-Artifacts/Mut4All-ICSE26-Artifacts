Mutation Operator: Modify Box Initialization with Different Allocator

This mutation operator targets the initialization of Box with a custom allocator. The goal is to modify the Box initialization in such a way that it might trigger allocator-related bugs in the Rust compiler.

1. Locate a Box initialization in the seed program where the Box is created using the `Box::new_in` method with a specified allocator.

2. Modify the Box initialization by replacing the existing allocator with `std::alloc::System`.

3. Ensure that the modified Box initialization still uses valid and compatible types and variables that are already present in the seed program to maintain context.

4. If the seed program does not use any specific allocator, introduce the use of `std::alloc::System` explicitly, and make sure that it is declared as follows:
   - Introduce a new use statement: `use std::alloc::System;`
   - Modify the Box initialization to use `System` instead of the previous allocator.

Example:
Original Code:
```
let mut node = Box::new_in(Node {
    v: &(),
    b: false,
}, &Global);
```

Mutated Code:
```
use std::alloc::System;

let mut node = Box::new_in(Node {
    v: &(),
    b: false,
}, &System);
```

This mutation targets programs that use custom allocators and modifies them to use a different system-based allocator. This change can potentially reveal hidden issues or inconsistencies in how the Rust compiler handles different allocator types, especially under optimization or specific compilation configurations.
