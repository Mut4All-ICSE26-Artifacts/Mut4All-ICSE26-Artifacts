Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Variant Pattern Matching

Target Code Construct: Enum pattern matching in `let` statements.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `let` statement with an enum pattern matching construct, such as `let <Enum>::Variant(..) =`.
2. Replace the pattern matching construct with a direct assignment from a constructed enum variant. 

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the `let` statement using an enum pattern, e.g., `let <E>::V(..) = expression;`.
- Remove the pattern matching ellipsis `(..)` and replace it with a direct construction of the enum variant with concrete values if necessary.
- Ensure that the enum variant assignment is compatible with the rest of the program's logic.

Example Pseudo-code Before Mutation:
```
let <E>::V(..) = E::V(|a, b| a.cmp(b));
```

Example Pseudo-code After Mutation:
```
let e_variant = E::V(10); // assuming `10` is an appropriate value for the variant
```

Rationale:
The mutation operator modifies the way enum variants are deconstructed and directly assigns a constructed variant, potentially altering the flow and triggering different paths in the compiler's handling of enums and pattern matching. This mutation focuses on enum variants and changes how they are used, promoting the discovery of hidden bugs in the handling of enums by the Rust compiler.
