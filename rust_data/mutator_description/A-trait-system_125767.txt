Mutation Operator 1: Modify the Trait Bound in Structs

Target: Structs with generic parameters and trait bounds.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition with a generic type parameter that has a trait bound. For example, a struct might be defined as:
   ```
   struct Bar<T: TraitBound>();
   ```
2. Modify the trait bound by:
   - Changing the trait bound to a different trait.
   - Removing the trait bound altogether.
   - Adding an additional trait bound.

Step-by-step instructions:
- Locate a struct definition with a generic parameter and its trait bound.
- Alter the trait bound in one of the specified ways.

Example:
Original code:
```
struct Bar<T: Clone>();
```

Mutated code (option 1 - change trait):
```
struct Bar<T: Debug>();
```

Mutated code (option 2 - remove trait):
```
struct Bar<T>();
```

Mutated code (option 3 - add additional trait):
```
struct Bar<T: Clone + PartialEq>();
```

These mutations investigate how the compiler handles trait bounds on generics, potentially revealing issues with different trait combinations or lack thereof.
