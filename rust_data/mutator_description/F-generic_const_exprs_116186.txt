Mutation Operator: Modify Array Length in Function Signature

Target: Function definition with arrays in parameters, especially those utilizing const generics.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that has array parameters with const generic lengths.
2. Modify the length of the array to introduce a new const generic that has not been evaluated.
3. Ensure the new const generic is declared but not instantiated within the scope of the function.

Example Mutation:
Original code:
```
pub fn process_data(data: &[i32; ARRAY_SIZE]) -> i32 {
    // function body
}
```

Mutation:
1. Introduce a new const generic `NEW_SIZE`.
2. Modify the array length to use the new const generic.
3. Declare `NEW_SIZE` within the function but do not provide an evaluable expression.

Mutated code:
```
pub fn process_data(data: &[i32; NEW_SIZE]) -> i32 {
    const NEW_SIZE: usize;
    // function body
}
```

This mutation operator leverages the Rust compiler's handling of unevaluated const generics, aiming to trigger ICEs related to type mismatches between expected sizes and unevaluated constants.
