Mutation Operator

Target: Generic Struct Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a struct definition that uses const generics, such as `struct SymmetricGroup<S> where [(); S::N]: Sized`.
2. Introduce an additional const generic parameter to the struct definition. For example, if the struct has a single const generic `N: usize`, modify it to have two constants, e.g., `N1: usize, N2: usize`.
3. Update the `where` clause to use both `N1` and `N2`. For example, change `[(); S::N]: Sized` to `[(); N1 + N2]: Sized`.
4. Ensure the struct is used in a context with valid constant expressions that match the new signature. Update any instantiation of the struct to pass two constant arguments instead of one.

Example (Pseudocode):
Original:
```rust
pub struct SymmetricGroup<S>
where
    S: Enumerable,
    [(); S::N]: Sized,
{
    _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<S>,
}
```
Mutated:
```rust
pub struct SymmetricGroup<S, const N1: usize, const N2: usize>
where
    S: Enumerable,
    [(); N1 + N2]: Sized,
{
    _phantom: std::marker::PhantomData<S>,
}
```
Note:
- The mutation should only alter existing generic parameters or add new ones while maintaining compatibility with the original code.
- Care should be taken to ensure that the expressions involving the new constants are valid and won't cause compilation errors unrelated to the mutation target.
