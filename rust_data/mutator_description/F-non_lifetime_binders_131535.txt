Mutation Operator:
Target: Trait Definitions
This mutation operator targets trait definitions, particularly those involving higher-ranked trait bounds and generic parameters. It focuses on modifying the use of generic lifetime parameters and associated type bindings to potentially trigger compiler bugs related to escaping bound variables and well-formedness checks.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait definition involving generic parameters and higher-ranked trait bounds (e.g., for<'a>).
2. Introduce a new generic parameter with a lifetimespecifier (e.g., <'x>) to the trait definition.
3. Modify the existing associated type or function signatures within the trait to use this new lifetime parameter in a way that causes potential conflicts or escapes bounds.
4. Ensure the modified trait still compiles, but with altered lifetime bounds that might trigger a bug.

Example:
Original Trait:
```rust
trait ExampleTrait<T> {
    fn example_method(&self, item: T);
}
```

Mutated Trait:
1. Add a new lifetime parameter `'x` to the trait definition.
2. Modify the method signature to incorporate the new lifetime.
```rust
trait ExampleTrait<'x, T> {
    fn example_method(&'x self, item: T);
}
```

By introducing a new lifetime parameter and altering the method signature, this mutation seeks to create a scenario that may lead to issues with bound variables escaping their intended scope, triggering bugs related to well-formed checks in the Rust compiler.
