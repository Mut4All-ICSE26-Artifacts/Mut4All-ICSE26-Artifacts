Mutation Operator: Modify Static Variable Initialization

Target Code Construct: Static variable initialization within a module.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a static variable declared within a module. In this bug report, the static variable `S_COUNT` is declared in the module `s`.
2. Ensure the static variable is an instance of a type that requires initialization (e.g., `AtomicUsize`).
3. Introduce an error in the initialization expression of the static variable. This can be done by:
   - Using an incorrect type for the initialization. For example, instead of initializing with `AtomicUsize::new(0)`, replace `0` with a different type such as a floating-point number like `0.0`.
   - Alternatively, use an uninitialized variable or invalid expression that can lead to a type mismatch or compilation failure.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
static S_COUNT: = AtomicUsize::new(0);
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
static S_COUNT: = AtomicUsize::new(0.0); // Introduced a type mismatch in the initialization
```

This mutation operator targets the initialization of static variables and introduces type mismatches, which are likely to trigger compiler errors during constant evaluation. By focusing on static variable initialization, we can expose issues related to incorrect type handling or ICEs in the Rust compiler. This operator has broad applicability across various Rust programs where static variables are used.
