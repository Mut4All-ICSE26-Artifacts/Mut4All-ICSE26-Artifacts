Mutation Operator: Incomplete Trait Implementation

Target Construct: Trait implementation for a struct or type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that is implemented for a struct or type in the seed program.
2. Remove or comment out one of the methods in the trait implementation, but ensure the trait is still declared as implemented.
3. If no trait implementations exist, choose an existing struct and declare a trait implementation for it with at least one method missing.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct;

trait MyTrait {
    fn method1(&self);
    fn method2(&self);
}

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn method1(&self) {
        // implementation code
    }
    
    fn method2(&self) {
        // implementation code
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
struct MyStruct;

trait MyTrait {
    fn method1(&self);
    fn method2(&self);
}

impl MyTrait for MyStruct {
    fn method1(&self) {
        // implementation code
    }
    // fn method2 is missing
}
```

This mutation operator causes an incomplete trait implementation, which can lead to compile-time errors in Rust, particularly when generic constraints or complex trait bounds are involved, potentially triggering ICEs in the compiler.
