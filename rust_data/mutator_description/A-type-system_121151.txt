Mutation Operator:

Target: Structs with unnamed fields

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify structs that contain unnamed fields, indicated by the use of underscores, e.g., `struct MyStruct { _: Type }`.
2. Convert the unnamed field to a named field. This involves:
   a. Assigning an arbitrary name to the unnamed field. For example, rename `_: Type` to `field_name: Type`. Ensure that the name `field_name` does not conflict with any existing names in the program.
3. If the struct is used in any function or expression, update the usage to reflect the new struct field name.

Example before mutation:
```
struct Example {
    _: i32,
}
```

Example after mutation:
```
struct Example {
    field_name: i32,
}
```

Where it applies: This mutation operator applies to Rust programs that define structs with unnamed fields. It should be utilized in any scenario where such structs are present and can potentially interact with other parts of the program, challenging the compiler with the process of renaming and scope recognition.
