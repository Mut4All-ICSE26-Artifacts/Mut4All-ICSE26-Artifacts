Mutation Operator: Incorrect Lifetime Specification

Target Code Construct:
The target for this mutation operator is functions with generic parameters, particularly those involving lifetimes.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a lifetime parameter or a return type involving lifetimes.
2. For each identified lifetime:
   a. Remove the current lifetime annotation (e.g., `'a`) from the function's parameters and replace it with an underscore (`'_`), which is a placeholder for an anonymous lifetime.
   b. Ensure to leave the function body unchanged to avoid compile-time checks correcting the issue.
3. If the function does not currently specify a lifetime, add an incorrect lifetime specification by inserting `'static` in a place where it does not belong.

Example of Mutation:
Given a function in the seed program:
```
fn process<'a>(input: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    input
}
```

Apply the mutation operator:
```
fn process(input: &'_ str) -> &'_ str {
    input
}
```

Explanation:
By using `'_`, the explicit lifetime is replaced with an anonymous one, which might not be correctly inferred by the compiler due to the complexity of the function logic or due to interactions with other traits, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior. This mutation is specifically crafted to explore how the Rust compiler handles lifetime elision and inference in complex scenarios with generics and trait bounds.
