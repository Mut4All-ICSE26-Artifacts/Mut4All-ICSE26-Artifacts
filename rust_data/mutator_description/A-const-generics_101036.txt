Mutation Operator: Enum with Default Const Generics Modification

Target Code Construct: Enum with default const generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum definition in the seed program that utilizes const generics with a default value.
2. Alter the default const generic expression to perform arithmetic operations involving multiple enum variants, ensuring that the operations exceed the range of the underlying type of the enum.
3. For instance, if the enum is declared with `#[repr(u8)]`, modify the arithmetic operations in the const generic to utilize the values of the variants, such that the sum or result exceeds `255` (the maximum value for `u8`).

Example in Pseudo-Code Form:
Original Enum:
```
#[repr(u8)]
enum MyEnum<const X: u8 = { MyEnum::<0>::First as u8 }> {
    First = 1,
    Second,
}
```

Mutated Enum:
```
#[repr(u8)]
enum MyEnum<const X: u8 = { MyEnum::<0>::First as u8 + MyEnum::<0>::Second as u8 + 250 }> {
    First = 1,
    Second,
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation operator modifies the default value of the const generic parameter in the enum definition by altering the arithmetic calculation. The new calculation is intended to exceed the maximum value that can be represented by the enum's underlying type (`u8` in this case). This overflows the result, potentially triggering compiler bugs due to range violations in const generic expressions. This operator takes advantage of existing enum variants and their assigned values, focusing on arithmetic operations that go beyond the limits of the type.
