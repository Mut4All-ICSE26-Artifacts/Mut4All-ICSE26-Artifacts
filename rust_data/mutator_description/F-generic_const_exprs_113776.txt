Mutation Operator: Replace Closure with Coroutine in Const Context

Target: This mutation operator is aimed at functions utilizing generic const expressions, particularly those with closure expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a closure within a constant context. This function should ideally be using the `#![feature(generic_const_exprs)]` attribute.
2. Locate the closure inside the function that is defined within a constant expression or as a part of a type parameter.
3. Replace the closure with an equivalent coroutine using the `async` or `await` keyword, ensuring the function body remains syntactically valid.

Example:

Original:
```rust
fn my_function<T>(
    data: &[(); {
        let x = || 5; // Closure within constant expression
        x()
    }],
) -> T {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutation:
```rust
fn my_function<T>(
    data: &[(); {
        let x = async { 5 }; // Coroutine replacing closure
        x.await
    }],
) -> T {
    // Function body
}
```

Explanation: By substituting a closure with a coroutine within a constant context, especially within type expressions or constraints, we increase the likelihood of triggering inconsistencies in the compilation process related to type inference and async/await features. This mutation tests the compiler's handling of advanced features in constant contexts.
