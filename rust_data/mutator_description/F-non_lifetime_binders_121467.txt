Mutation Operator 1: Modify Function Generics and Traits

Target Code Construct: Functions with Generics

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that uses generics and has a trait bound on the generic type(s).
2. Modify the trait bound to add a non-lifetime binder with a `for<>` clause. This involves adding a new trait constraint that requires the generic type to implement a function-like trait over arbitrary types.
3. Ensure that the modified function is used in a context that triggers type checking, e.g., by passing it as an argument to another function that expects a closure or function pointer.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the function definition, such as `fn my_function<T>(param: T) {}`.
- Modify the function signature to include an additional trait bound using a `for<>` clause. For example, change `fn my_function<T>(param: T)` to `fn my_function<T>(_param: T) where for<U> T: Fn(U)`.
- Ensure that the function is used in a way that causes type inference to occur. For instance, pass it as an argument to another function, as shown: `fn takes_closure<F>(_closure: F) where F: Fn(i32) {}`. Call this with `takes_closure(my_function)`.

Example Pseudo-code:
```
fn process<T>(value: T) {}

fn execute_closure<F>(closure: F)
where
    for<U> F: Fn(U),
{
}

fn main() {
    execute_closure(process);
}
```

This mutation operator aims to modify existing function generics and trait bounds to introduce non-lifetime binders, which can potentially expose issues related to trait resolution and type inference in the compiler.
