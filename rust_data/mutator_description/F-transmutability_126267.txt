Mutation Operator: Enum Variant Modification

Target: Enum definitions with multiple variants

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum declaration with multiple variants. For instance, in the provided bug report, the `Error` enum contains multiple variants.
2. Add a new variant to the enum. This variant should follow the same pattern as existing ones but introduce a new struct as its associated data.
3. Declare a new struct to be used with the new enum variant. Ensure that this struct has a different field type than those used in other variants of the enum.
4. Modify any function or type assertions involving the enum to account for the new variant if necessary. If a test function is verifying transmutability or type traits of the enum, ensure it still compiles.

Example:
Original Enum:
```rust
pub enum Example {
    Variant1,
    Variant2 { source: ExistingStruct },
}
```

Mutated Enum:
```rust
pub struct NewStruct {
    x: i32,
}

pub enum Example {
    Variant1,
    Variant2 { source: ExistingStruct },
    Variant3 { source: NewStruct },  // New variant with a new struct
}
```

Steps:
- Locate an enum with multiple variants in the seed Rust program.
- Add a new variant to the enum, using a newly declared struct with unique fields.
- Ensure any related functions or assertions are updated to address the changes, maintaining the overall logic and functionality.

By adding a new variant to an existing enum and using a distinct struct for its data, this mutation operator exploits potential weaknesses in enum handling logic, especially in transmutability contexts, which might lead to compiler bugs similar to those described in the bug report.
