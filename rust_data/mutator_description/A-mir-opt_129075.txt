Mutation Operator: Array Size Mismatch in Struct

Target: Structs with array fields

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct in the code that contains an array as a field, such as `struct Foo<T>([T; 2]);`.

2. Locate the implementation of a function or method that initializes or returns an instance of the struct, such as a `default` method in the `Default` trait implementation.

3. Alter the size of the array in the struct definition or in the function/method that initializes it:
   - If the original array size is `[T; 2]`, change the initialization to use a different size, such as `[T; 3]` or `[T; 1]`.

Example:
Original Struct:
```rust
struct Foo<T>([T; 2]);

impl<T: Default + Copy> Default for Foo<T> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Foo([Default::default(); 2])
    }
}
```

Mutated Struct:
```rust
struct Foo<T>([T; 3]); // Changed array size in struct

impl<T: Default + Copy> Default for Foo<T> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Foo([Default::default(); 2]) // Mismatch with struct definition
    }
}
```

4. Ensure that the array size mismatch is consistent across various uses in the program, particularly where instances are created or destructured, to increase the likelihood of triggering a compiler bug.

This mutation targets inconsistencies between array sizes defined in structs and those used in functions or methods, which can lead to index out-of-bound errors or other internal compiler errors during type checking or MIR optimizations.
