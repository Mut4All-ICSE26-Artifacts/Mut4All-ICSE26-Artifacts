Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Variant to Use PhantomData

This mutation operator targets enum definitions, specifically the variants of enums. The mutation rule proposes introducing a `PhantomData` field to an existing enum variant or replacing the current payload of a variant with `PhantomData`. This change can potentially lead to layout issues or unexpected behavior in the Rust compiler.

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:
1. Identify an enum in the code that defines multiple variants, such as `SomeEnum`.
2. Select a variant that has a payload, ensuring it is not a simple unit variant.
3. Modify the selected variant to include a `PhantomData` field. If the variant already has fields, add `PhantomData` as an additional field. If it is a tuple-like variant, replace the existing payload with a `PhantomData` of some type.
4. Ensure that the modified enum variant uses a type that is relevant to the context of the code, leveraging types already present in the program (e.g., `usize`, `i32`).

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
enum SomeEnum {
    Unit,
    Tuple(UnitStruct),
    Struct {
        inner: usize,
    },
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
enum SomeEnum {
    Unit,
    Tuple(std::marker::PhantomData<i32>), // Changed to use PhantomData
    Struct {
        inner: usize,
    },
}
```

In this example, the `Tuple` variant of `SomeEnum` has been mutated to use `PhantomData<i32>` instead of its original payload. This kind of change is prone to triggering layout bugs and inconsistencies with the Rust compiler, particularly when dealing with scalar ranges and derived implementations such as `Default`.
