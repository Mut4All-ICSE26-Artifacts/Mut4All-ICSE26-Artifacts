Mutation Operator: Refactor Pattern Matching to Use Identifier

This mutation targets pattern matching constructs within a function's scope. It specifically applies to pattern bindings involving structs when the pattern uses forbidden keywords such as `Self`. The mutation operator refines the pattern to replace the keyword with a valid identifier, thus preventing potential compiler crashes.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any pattern matching constructs in the function that use a struct pattern with a keyword that is not allowed as an identifier. An example of a problematic pattern is `let S { ref Self } = ...`.
2. Replace the keyword `Self` with a valid identifier. A valid identifier is any name that conforms to Rust's rules for identifiers, such as alphabetical characters followed optionally by digits or underscores.
3. Ensure that the replacement maintains the original structure logic while complying with Rust's syntax rules for identifiers.
4. Apply the same modification to any similar constructs in the function, ensuring consistency and adherence to the identified rules.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```rust
impl Foo {
    fn main() {
        let S { ref Self } = some_value;
    }
}
```

After Mutation:
```rust
impl Foo {
    fn main() {
        let S { ref id } = some_value;
    }
}
```

In this example, `Self` is replaced with `id`, which is a valid identifier, thus preventing the compiler from encountering an unexpected keyword in the pattern. This mutation helps prevent internal compiler errors associated with pattern matching using reserved keywords.
