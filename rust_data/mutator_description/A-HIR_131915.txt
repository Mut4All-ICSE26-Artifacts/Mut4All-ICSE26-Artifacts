Mutation Operator: Modify Macro Invocation and Constant Definition

Target Code Construct: Macro invocation within constant definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a macro rule that is used within a constant definition.
2. Modify the macro rule such that it outputs a type definition (e.g., struct, enum) instead of an expression or value. This type should mirror the type expected by the constant definition.
3. Ensure the type definition is not declared elsewhere in the program, leading to a type that cannot be found in scope, thus triggering a potential compiler bug.

Example:
- Original:
  ```
  macro_rules! y {
      ($($matcher:tt)*) => {
          x
      };
  }

  const _: A<{
      y! { test.tou8 }
  }>;
  ```

- Mutated:
  ```
  macro_rules! y {
      ($($matcher:tt)*) => {
          struct UndefinedType;
      };
  }

  const _: UndefinedType<{
      y! { test.tou8 }
  }>;
  ```
  
Note: The mutation introduces a type `UndefinedType` within the macro that does not exist in the program's scope, simulating a scenario where a defined type is expected but not available, which might lead to a compilation issue or internal compiler error.
