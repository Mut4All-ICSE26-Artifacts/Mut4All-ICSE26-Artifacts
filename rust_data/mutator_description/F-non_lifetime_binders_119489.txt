Mutation Operator:

Target Code Construct: Function Signature

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function signature that uses generic type parameters and associated constraints, particularly with const expressions.
2. Locate the `where` clause within the function signature that defines constraints involving generic types or constants (e.g., `T: Copy` and `const` expressions).
3. Introduce an additional `const` parameter within the `where` clause, ensuring it involves an arithmetic operation with type parameters. For instance, if the original parameter is `const NP: usize = { N + 1usize }`, extend it to another similar `const` using the existing `N` or similar variable.
4. Modify the operation or value involving this new `const` so that it creates an inter-dependency with existing constants, like `const NM: usize = { NP - 2 }`.
5. Ensure the new `const` parameter is a valid arithmetic expression that leverages already defined constants and types to ensure the mutation is broadly applicable.

Example:
Original:
```rust
fn a()
where
    for<T, const N: usize, const NP: usize = { N + 1usize }> T: Copy,
{
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
fn a()
where
    for<T, const N: usize, const NP: usize = { N + 1usize }, const NM: usize = { NP - 2 }> T: Copy,
{
}
```

Note: This mutation operator aims to exploit potential compiler limitations in handling complex inter-relationships between const expressions within function signatures, which can trigger bugs such as the one reported.
