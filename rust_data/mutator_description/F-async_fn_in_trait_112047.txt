Mutation Operator: Modify Trait Implementation to Include Recursive Async Calls

Target Code Construct: Implementation of traits for structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that implements a trait with at least one async function, similar to how `A` implements `First` in the provided code.
2. Locate the async function within the trait implementation.
3. In the body of the async function, incorporate a recursive call pattern using an existing method.
   - If there is a single async method, create a self-referential call using multiple awaits invoking another async method.
4. Ensure that the recursive call uses proper chaining of async methods to highlight potential normalization or recursion issues in trait methods.
5. Avoid introducing new methods; instead, leverage existing methods from the trait or struct.

Example Transformation:
Original Implementation:
```rust
impl First for A {
    type Second = A;
    async fn first(self) -> Self::Second {
        A
    }
}
```

Mutated Implementation:
```rust
impl First for A {
    type Second = A;
    async fn first(self) -> Self::Second {
        // Introduced recursion using existing async methods
        self.first().await
    }
}
```

This mutation operator exploits potential weaknesses in handling recursive async calls within trait implementations by leveraging existing code structures and methods.
