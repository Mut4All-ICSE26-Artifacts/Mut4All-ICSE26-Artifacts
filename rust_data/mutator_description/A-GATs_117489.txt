Mutation Operator

Target: Lifetime annotations in GATs (Generic Associated Types) within trait implementations.

Objective: Manipulate lifetimes in GATs to potentially trigger lifetime-related issues or compiler crashes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait that uses GATs with lifetime parameters. In the provided code, this is the `LendingIterator` trait with `type Item<'a>`.
2. Alter the bound on `Self` associated with the lifetime constraint. For example, change `Self: 'a` to a conflicting lifetime constraint or an incorrect relation like `'a: 'static`.
3. Ensure the mutation is realistic and doesn't introduce syntax errors, focusing on logical changes that could expose bugs in the compiler's handling of lifetimes.

Step-by-step:
a. Locate the line defining the GAT with lifetime bounds, e.g., `type Item<'a> = &'a u32 where Self: 'a;`.
b. Alter the lifetime constraint to something potentially problematic. For instance, change the constraint to `where 'a: 'static;`.
c. Keep all other parts of the code the same to ensure the mutation specifically targets the lifetime handling in GATs.

Example (Pseudocode):
Before Mutation:
```rust
type Item<'a> = &'a u32 where Self: 'a;
```

After Mutation:
```rust
type Item<'a> = &'a u32 where 'a: 'static;
```

This mutation is designed to stress-test the compiler's lifetime resolution and constraint checking mechanism, particularly in the context of GATs. It can potentially expose ICEs (Internal Compiler Errors) related to lifetime mismanagement or incorrect bound inference.
