Mutation Operator: Modify Packed Union Alignment

Target: Union declarations with a `repr(packed)` attribute.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a union type declaration in the seed program that uses the `#[repr(packed(n))]` attribute, where `n` is any integer value specifying the packing alignment.
2. Change the `n` value in the `repr(packed)` attribute to a value larger than the natural alignment of any field within the union. For example, if the union has a `u32` field (which typically has a natural alignment of 4 bytes), set `n` to a value of 5 or higher.
3. Ensure that the modified alignment value still complies with the valid range for the `#[repr(packed(n))]` attribute, which is 1 to the largest field's natural alignment.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
#[repr(packed(1))]
union MyUnion {
    field: u32,
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
#[repr(packed(5))]
union MyUnion {
    field: u32,
}
```

This mutation aims to create a potential misalignment situation that the Rust compiler may not handle correctly, leading to an internal compiler error or unexpected behavior. Note that this operator is designed to exploit edge cases in alignment handling rather than guaranteed bugs in the compiler.
