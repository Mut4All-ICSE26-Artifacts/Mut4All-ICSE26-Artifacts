Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Function with Type Casting
This mutation operator targets function bodies where type casting is involved, specifically focusing on casting to or from trait objects.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that involves type casting of a trait object, such as casting a reference of `&dyn Trait` to `dyn* Trait`.
2. Replace the existing casting operation with an alternate casting that forces interaction with the `dyn_star` feature, which is known to cause issues.
3. Specifically, introduce a cast from a trait object reference (`&dyn Trait`) directly to a `dyn* Trait` to simulate the buggy scenario.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
trait MyTrait {}

fn example_function(x: &dyn MyTrait) {
    // Original casting operation that is safe
    let y = x as &dyn MyTrait;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait MyTrait {}

fn example_function(x: &dyn MyTrait) {
    // Mutated casting operation using `dyn_star` feature
    let y = *x as dyn* MyTrait;
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation directly modifies type casting operations within functions to leverage the problematic `dyn_star` feature. By changing how a trait object reference is cast (especially introducing a dereference and recasting using `dyn*`), it is likely to encounter the compiler bug related to this specific feature, thereby increasing the chances of triggering an internal compiler error.
