Mutation Operator:
Target: Trait method definitions with extern "C" function declaration

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a trait definition containing a method with an `extern "C"` function declaration.
2. Modify the method's signature by replacing the return type with `impl Trait` where `Trait` is any trait available in the current module context. If no applicable trait is available, introduce a basic trait as follows:
   - Define a new trait, `trait DummyTrait { fn dummy(&self) -> i32; }`, in the same module.
   - Use `impl DummyTrait` as the return type.
3. Ensure that the method body remains unchanged after the mutation.
4. Example pseudo-code transformation:

Original:
```
pub trait Foo {
    extern "C" fn foo_(&self, _: ()) -> i64 {
        0
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```
trait DummyTrait {
    fn dummy(&self) -> i32;
}

pub trait Foo {
    extern "C" fn foo_(&self, _: ()) -> impl DummyTrait {
        0
    }
}
```

This mutation targets the `extern "C"` function signature specifically and attempts to introduce `impl Trait` return types, which are not typically used with FFI functions, and may trigger issues in the type-checking or linting stages of the compiler.
