Mutation Operator: Modify Array Length in Struct Initialization

Target Code Construct: Struct Initialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with an array field initialized using a constant expression involving arithmetic or other operations.
2. Modify the length of the array field in the struct initialization to an arbitrary value that is one more or one less than a constant expression involving variables or constants. 
3. Ensure that the array field can hold the new length (e.g., update any dependent code that uses this field if necessary).

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Sample {
    pub items: [i32; 5],
}

impl Sample {
    const fn new() -> Self {
        Sample { items: [0; 5] }
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Sample {
    pub items: [i32; 6], // Increase the array size by 1
}

impl Sample {
    const fn new() -> Self {
        Sample { items: [0; 6] } // Reflect the change in initialization
    }
}
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, the length of the array `items` within the `Sample` struct is modified from 5 to 6. This mutation targets areas where array sizes are determined using constant arithmetic expressions and modifies them to potentially trigger assertion failures or other issues related to layout and type checking within the Rust compiler. This mutation can expose bugs in the compiler's handling of array sizes and layout determination during constant evaluation.
