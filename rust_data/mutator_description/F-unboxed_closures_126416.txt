Mutation Operator: Alter Trait Bounds in Function

Target: Function Parameter Trait Bounds

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with a generic parameter that has a trait bound. In this case, the function is `do_something_wrapper` with the parameter `F` where `F: for<'a> FnOnce(<F as Output<i32>>::Type)`.
2. Change the trait bound to include an additional unrelated or conflicting trait. This modification aims to test how the compiler handles edge cases in trait bound resolution. 
3. If necessary, declare the new trait within the code to maintain validity.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
impl Wrapper {
    fn do_something_wrapper<O, F>(&mut self, _: F)
    where
        F: for<'a> FnOnce(<F as Output<i32>>::Type),
    {
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
trait Extra {}

impl Wrapper {
    fn do_something_wrapper<O, F>(&mut self, _: F)
    where
        F: for<'a> FnOnce(<F as Output<i32>>::Type) + Extra,
    {
    }
}
``` 

Explanation: Add a new trait, `Extra`, and require any type implementing `F` to also implement `Extra`. This tests the compiler's ability to handle cases where additional and possibly conflicting trait requirements are added to an existing function signature.
