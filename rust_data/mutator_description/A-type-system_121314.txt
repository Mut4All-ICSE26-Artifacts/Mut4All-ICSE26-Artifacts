Mutation Operator: Modify Function Return Type

Target: Functions with complex or generic return types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program with a return type specified as `impl Trait`.
2. Replace the `impl Trait` return type with a concrete type that can be derived from the context of the function, ensuring the replacement adheres to the function's behavior and logic.
3. If the function's logic does not directly map to a single concrete type, introduce a new struct with the required trait implementations. Declare this struct within the same module as the function to avoid scope issues.

Example:
Original Function:
```
pub fn example_function() -> impl TraitName {
    // Some logic here
}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Analyze the function's logic to determine a suitable concrete type. If the function is returning a collection or wrapping another type, consider using that type as the return type.
2. If the concrete type is not directly derivable:
   a. Define a new struct suited to the function's return behavior within the module.
   b. Implement the required trait(s) for this struct.
3. Replace the `impl TraitName` with the identified concrete type or the new struct.

Example Mutation:
```
pub struct ExampleStruct; // New struct definition

impl TraitName for ExampleStruct {
    // Implement required methods
}

pub fn example_function() -> ExampleStruct {
    // Some logic here
    ExampleStruct // Return an instance of the new struct
}
```

This mutation operator targets the Rust type system's handling of `impl Trait` return types, potentially revealing inconsistencies or bugs when concrete types are substituted.
