Mutation Operator: Modify Type Constraints in Trait Implementation

Target Construct: Trait implementation (`impl`) for a generic type

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the implementation of a trait for a generic type in the code.
2. Locate the associated type definition within this implementation.
3. Change the associated type to a different generic container or type that leverages the existing type parameter.
4. Ensure that the new type is compatible with the rest of the code by analyzing the usage of the associated type.

Example:
Original code snippet:
```rust
impl<C> SpecTrait for C {
    default type Assoc = Vec<Self>;
}
```

Mutation steps:
1. Identify that `SpecTrait` is implemented for the generic type `C`.
2. Locate the `Assoc` type defined as `Vec<Self>`.
3. Mutate the `Assoc` type to another generic container like `Option<Self>`.

Mutated code snippet:
```rust
impl<C> SpecTrait for C {
    default type Assoc = Option<Self>;
}
```

This mutation operator systematically changes the type used in trait implementations, which can potentially expose issues with how generics and associated types interact in the presence of Rust's specialization feature. Ensure that the changes maintain the syntactic and semantic correctness of the program.
