Mutation Operator: Modify Tuple Pattern Assignment

Target Construct: Tuple pattern assignments within a function, specifically within the body of an `impl` block.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a tuple pattern assignment within a function body. This typically looks like `(pattern1, pattern2, ...) = (expr1, expr2, ...)`.
2. Introduce a mismatch in the types or structures within the tuple pattern or the right-hand side expressions to simulate a type-checking inconsistency that could trigger a compiler bug.
3. Use existing variables or introduce new ones if necessary, but ensure they are well-defined in the context. If introducing a new variable, declare it with a basic type like `let new_var: i32 = 0;` before the mutated assignment line.
4. Alter one or more elements in the assignment to create a type mismatch. For instance, if the original code is `(Self, a) = (S, ());`, modify it to `(Self, a) = (S, a);` where `a` might be an integer or any other distinct type that mismatches with the expected unit type `()`.

Example:

Original:
```rust
struct MyStruct(i32, ());

impl MyStruct {
    fn example() {
        let x: ();
        (Self, x) = (MyStruct, ()); // Original assignment
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```rust
struct MyStruct(i32, ());

impl MyStruct {
    fn example() {
        let x: i32 = 42; // Change type of x to create a mismatch
        (Self, x) = (MyStruct, x); // Mutated assignment with type mismatch
    }
}
```

This operator exploits the pattern matching and type inference aspects of Rust, which are sensitive to type mismatches, potentially revealing bugs in the compiler's pattern handling.
