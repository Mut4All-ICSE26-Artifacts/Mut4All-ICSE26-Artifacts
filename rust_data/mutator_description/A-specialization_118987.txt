Mutation Operator: Trait Implementation Mutation

Target: This mutation operator targets trait implementation blocks in Rust code, specifically when a trait is implemented for a type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a trait implementation block in the seed program. This is a block where a trait is being implemented for a type, marked by `impl Trait for Type {}`.
2. Modify the associated type or output type within the implementation:
   - If the trait `Assoc` is being implemented with an associated type `type Output = SomeType;`, alter the type of `Output` to a different compatible type that can be reasonably expected to be used in the context.
   - For instance, if `type Output = bool;`, change it to another simple type like `type Output = i32;` or any other relevant type based on the program context.

Example:
Original seed program:
```
trait Assoc {
    type Output;
}

impl Assoc for u8 {
    type Output = bool;
}
```

Mutated version:
```
trait Assoc {
    type Output;
}

impl Assoc for u8 {
    type Output = i32;
}
```

The objective is to induce variations in specialization and associated type handling, potentially triggering specialization-related issues or internal compiler errors (ICE) if the compiler's handling of these cases is flawed. This mutation is designed to explore the robustness of type specialization and trait implementation logic, which is a critical area in Rust's type system.
