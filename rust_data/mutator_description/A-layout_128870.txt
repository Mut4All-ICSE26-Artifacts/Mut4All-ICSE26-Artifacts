Mutation Operator: Change `#[repr(packed)]` to `#[repr(C)]` on Enums

Target: Enum definitions that use the `#[repr(packed)]` attribute.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any enum definition in the code that is annotated with `#[repr(packed)]`.
2. Replace the `#[repr(packed)]` attribute with `#[repr(C)]`.

Example:
Original Code:
```rust
#[repr(packed)]
enum Example {
    Variant1,
    Variant2,
}
```

Mutated Code:
```rust
#[repr(C)]
enum Example {
    Variant1,
    Variant2,
}
```

Rationale: The `#[repr(packed)]` attribute on enums can lead to alignment issues, especially when used in conjunction with other constructs like unions or structs. By replacing it with `#[repr(C)]`, you maintain a defined layout but avoid potential alignment problems that are more likely to expose bugs in the compiler's layout calculation process. This mutation targets the layout and alignment aspects, which are key in the bug report provided.
