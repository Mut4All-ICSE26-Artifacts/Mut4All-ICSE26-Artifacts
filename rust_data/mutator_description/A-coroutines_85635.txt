Mutation Operator: Box and Yield Interaction

Target Code Construct: Closure with Generators and Box Syntax

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a closure that contains a generator expression using `yield`.
2. Ensure that the generator expression is being boxed using the `box` syntax.
3. Modify the boxed generator expression by introducing a direct assignment to a mutable reference or a mutable variable using `Box::new` to encapsulate the generator.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Locate the closure in the seed program that uses a generator expression like `|| yield;`.
2. Ensure this generator expression is wrapped using the `box` syntax, forming a statement like `|| box yield;`.
3. Modify this expression by introducing a mutable variable `let mut gen_box = Box::new(|| yield;);` within a function or directly within `main`.
4. Replace the original boxed yield closure with this new boxed assignment.

Example:
Original Code:
```
fn main() {
    || box yield;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
fn main() {
    let mut gen_box = Box::new(|| yield);
}
```

Note: This mutation emphasizes testing scenarios where boxed generator expressions might interact with mutable references, thus potentially uncovering compiler behaviors associated with memory layouts and control flow in the presence of Rust's borrowing and ownership rules.
