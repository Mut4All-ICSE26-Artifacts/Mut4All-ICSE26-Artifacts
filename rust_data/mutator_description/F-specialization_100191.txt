Mutation Operator: Specialization Trait Impl Mutation

Target Code Construct: Trait Implementation with Specialization

Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a trait implementation that uses specialization (i.e., an `impl` block marked with `default` or that is part of a specialization hierarchy).
Step 2: Modify the type parameters of the trait in the implementation to create a potential conflict or overlap with another implementation.
Step 3: Specifically, change the associated type or the type parameter in a way that introduces ambiguity between the specialized and default implementations, focusing on scenarios where the compiler has to resolve complex trait bounds.

Example:
Consider the following trait and its implementations:

Original Code:
```rust
pub trait MyTrait<T> {
    type Output;
}

default impl<T> MyTrait<T> for Vec<T> {
    type Output = T;
}

impl<T> MyTrait<T> for Option<T> {
    type Output = T;
}
```

Mutated Content:
1. Change the `default impl` to a more specific type that could overlap with the specialized implementation, introducing potential ambiguity:
```rust
default impl<T: Default> MyTrait<T> for Vec<T> {
    type Output = T;
}
```

2. Alternatively, introduce a nested complex type with ambiguous specialization:
```rust
impl<T: Iterator> MyTrait<T::Item> for T {
    type Output = T::Item;
}
```

Rationale:
By altering the specificity and bounds of the trait implementations, this mutation operator targets the Rust compiler's handling of specialization. It leverages potential overlaps and ambiguities in trait bounds that can stress-test the compiler's coherence and specialization logic, leading to issues like internal compiler errors (ICE) or unexpected behavior, especially in complex type hierarchies. This mutation is designed to be broadly applicable across different Rust programs featuring trait specialization.
