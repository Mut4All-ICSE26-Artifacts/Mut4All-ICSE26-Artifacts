Mutation Operator: Modify Const Function Return Type

Target Construct: Const functions (`const fn`)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `const fn` declaration in the seed program. The function should have a return type that includes `impl` or any advanced type composition.
   Example: `const fn example() -> impl SomeTrait { ... }`

2. Modify the return type to include an incorrect or nonexistent keyword or type that closely resembles an existing valid identifier.
   - Change: Replace a valid part of the return type with a similar, but incorrect or invalid keyword.
   - Example Change: Replace `impl Trait` with `~const Trait` or `impl ~const fn()`.
   - Original: `const fn example() -> impl SomeTrait { ... }`
   - Modified: `const fn example() -> impl ~const SomeTrait { ... }`

3. Ensure that the modified return type mimics the syntax error present in the bug report by introducing elements that can cause name resolution issues or parser confusion.

4. Compile the modified code to observe potential compilation errors or internal compiler errors (ICE) induced by the mutation.

Rationale: This mutation operator targets the complex type system and function return types that involve traits or advanced compositions, which are prone to triggering compiler panics or errors due to improper handling or parsing by the compiler.
