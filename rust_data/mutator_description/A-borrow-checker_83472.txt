Mutation Operator:

Target: Function return types

Mutation Rule: Modify a function's return type to use `impl Trait` with a generator inside the function body.

Steps:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that has a conventional return type (e.g., `i32`, `String`, etc.).
2. Change the function's return type to `impl Trait` (replace `Trait` with a placeholder indicating a trait that the return type would normally implement).
3. Introduce a `yield` expression within the function body to simulate generator behavior, ensuring that it is syntactically incorrect by omitting necessary attributes or context.

Example Transformation:

Original function:
```
fn example_function() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

Mutated function:
```
fn example_function() -> impl {
    yield
}
```

This mutation targets the borrow checker and type resolution mechanisms by creating an invalid use of `impl Trait` combined with a generator-like construct. It exploits the interaction between the borrow checker and type inference by presenting a scenario that the current compiler implementation may not handle gracefully, thus increasing the likelihood of triggering a compiler bug or crash.
