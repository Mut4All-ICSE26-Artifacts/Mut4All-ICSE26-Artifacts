Mutation Operator: Modify Const Generics with Invalid Type

Target: Function Definitions using Const Generics

Objective: To explore scenarios where the Rust compiler's type checking of const generics leads to internal errors, particularly when dealing with incomplete features like `adt_const_params`.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Identify functions that use const generics in their signature.
   Example:
   ```rust
   pub fn example<const Y: <i32 as SomeTrait>::AssociatedType>() {}
   ```

2. Change the type used in the const generic to one that is known to be incompatible or incorrect within the given context.
   - Locate the const generic parameter type within the function signature.
   - Replace the existing type with one that is intentionally incorrect or incompatible, such as a non-primitive type in place of a primitive type.
   
   Example Mutation:
   ```rust
   // Original
   pub fn example<const Y: <i32 as SomeTrait>::AssociatedType>() {}

   // Mutated
   pub fn example<const Y: <String as SomeTrait>::AssociatedType>() {}
   ```

3. Ensure that the mutated function still fits within the compiling context without needing additional imports or trait implementations that are not already part of the seed code.

4. Validate that the mutation is syntactically correct but semantically incorrect to trigger type errors during compilation.

This mutation operator is designed to exploit the complexities of handling const generics and associated types, especially under the experimental feature flags, which are prone to incomplete implementations and internal compiler errors.
