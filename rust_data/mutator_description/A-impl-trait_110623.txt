Mutation Operator: Modify Opaque Return Types in Recursive Functions

Target: Function Definitions

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a function in the seed program that returns an opaque type using `impl Trait`. Specifically, look for functions that use `impl Trait` as their return type, especially within recursive contexts. These are often indicated by return statements that use `impl Iterator<Item = Type>`.

2. Modify the return type by introducing a type alias that describes the opaque type. For instance, replace `impl Iterator<Item = Type>` with a type alias like `type MyIter = impl Iterator<Item = Type>;`.

3. Apply the alias in the function definition. Change the function signature to use the newly defined type alias. For example, a function with a signature like `fn example() -> impl Iterator<Item = Type> { /*...*/ }` should be changed to `fn example() -> MyIter { /*...*/ }`.

4. Ensure that the alias is defined at a higher scope than the function, such as at the module level, to maintain visibility.

5. Re-run the program to check for compilation errors or unexpected behavior. The focus is on how the compiler handles this type alias in recursive or complex function constructs.

Example:

Original Function:
```rust
fn example() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    // function logic
}
```

Mutated Version:
```rust
type MyIter = impl Iterator<Item = i32>;

fn example() -> MyIter {
    // function logic
}
```

This mutation exploits potential weaknesses in the Rust compiler's handling of opaque types and recursive structures, which may trigger internal compiler errors or unexpected behavior.
