Mutation Operator: Misuse of Compiler Intrinsics in Function Return

1. Target Code Construct: Function Return Statements
   - This mutation operator targets the return statements within functions, specifically those attempting to use intrinsic functions or compiler-specific features incorrectly.

2. Mutation Rule:
   a. Identify a function in the seed program that returns a value using a compiler-specific intrinsic or a macro-like feature.
   b. Replace the correct use of the intrinsic with an incorrect syntax or argument list to simulate the improper usage.
   c. Ensure the modification involves a feature that requires arguments, and leave one or more arguments missing or incorrectly typed.

3. Step-by-Step Instructions:
   - Locate a function in the seed program with a return statement using a well-formed intrinsic, e.g., `__builtin_expect`.
   - Modify the intrinsic call by either:
     i. Omitting necessary arguments, or
     ii. Providing arguments of incorrect types.
   - For instance, if you have `return __builtin_expect(expression, expected_value);`, mutate it to `return __builtin_expect(expression);` or `return __builtin_expect(expression, "expected_value");`.

4. Example of Mutation:
   Original Code:
   ```cpp
   int optimize(int condition) {
     return __builtin_expect(condition, 1);
   }
   ```

   Mutated Code:
   ```cpp
   int optimize(int condition) {
     return __builtin_expect(condition);
   }
   ```

   - In this example, the intrinsic function call `__builtin_expect` is missing the second argument, which is required, simulating improper usage similar to the bug report's misuse of `__array_extent`.

This mutation operator introduces errors in intrinsic calls, which can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior, thus aiming to trigger similar compiler bugs.
