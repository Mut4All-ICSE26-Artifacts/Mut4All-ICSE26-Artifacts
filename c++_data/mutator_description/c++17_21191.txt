Mutation Operator: Invalid Decltype in Generic Lambda

Target Construct: Generic Lambda Expression

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression in the seed program. This lambda must be a generic lambda that uses auto in its parameter list.
2. Inside the lambda, locate a return statement.
3. Apply `decltype` to this return statement to determine the return type of the lambda.
4. Alter the `decltype` expression to reference an invalid or undefined expression or type, such as an uninitialized variable or an undeclared type.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto x) { return x + 1; };
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto x) -> decltype(undefined_variable) { return x + 1; };
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets a generic lambda expression and deliberately introduces an invalid `decltype` expression, which is likely to cause the compiler to crash due to the invalid nature of the type deduction attempt. This exploits the parsing and type deduction logic within the compiler, potentially triggering errors similar to the bug described.
