Mutation Operator:

Target: Class/Struct Definition

Mutation Rule: 
Step 1: Identify a class or struct definition within the code.
Step 2: Inside the class or struct body, introduce an inline variable template at the top.
Step 3: Ensure the inline variable template has a generic type parameter and a default value.
Step 4: After declaring the template, insert a semicolon immediately after its declaration, mimicking the pattern seen in the bug trace.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Baz {
    // Existing members
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Baz {
    template<typename T> inline constexpr int value = 42;  // Added inline variable template
    ;
    // Existing members
};
```

This mutation operator targets the specific structure observed in the bug report, where an inline variable template is followed by a semicolon, potentially triggering parsing issues in the compiler.
