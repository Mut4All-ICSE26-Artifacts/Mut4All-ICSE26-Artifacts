Mutation Operator: Annotation Token Placement in Function Declaration

Target Code Construct: This mutation targets function declarations with annotations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function declaration within the seed C++ source code. Ensure that this function has a return type and parameters declared.
2. Introduce an annotation token preceding the function declaration. This annotation should be syntactically formatted as an attribute or similar construct.
3. Ensure that this annotation token is misplaced or incorrectly formatted to mimic an erroneous condition that can trigger compiler issues. For instance, place the annotation in between the function's return type and function name or inside the parameter list, where it does not logically belong.

Example:
Original Code (Pseudo-Code):
```cpp
int myFunction(int param) {
    return param + 1;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
[[unknown_annotation]] int myFunction(int param) {
    return param + 1;
}
```

4. If the seed program lacks any annotation tokens, declare a new annotation at the global scope before applying it to the function. Ensure the annotation is declared in a manner that appears valid for testing purposes.
5. Compile the modified code to test for crashes or assertion failures in the compiler.

Note: The placement and form of the annotation should be carefully chosen to maximize the likelihood of revealing compiler handling issues similar to those identified in the bug report.
