Mutation Operator: Modify Method with Explicit Object Parameter

Target Construct: Struct Method with Explicit Object Parameter

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with a method that uses an explicit object parameter (e.g., `void method(this StructType& obj)`).
2. Modify the method to include a self-referential call within its body. The self-referential call is where the method calls itself or calls another method of the same struct using the explicit object parameter.
3. Ensure that the self-referential call involves an operation that uses the object itself, potentially leading to recursive actions or unexpected behaviors.

Example:
Consider a struct `MyStruct` with a method `calculate` that takes an explicit object parameter.

Original Code:
```
template <typename T>
struct MyStruct {
    void calculate(this MyStruct<T>& obj) {
        // Original logic here
    }
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
template <typename T>
struct MyStruct {
    void calculate(this MyStruct<T>& obj) {
        obj.calculate(); // Self-referential call using explicit object parameter
    }
};
```

Explanation:
The mutation involves modifying the method `calculate` to include a call to itself using the explicit object parameter `obj`. This recursive call can trigger compiler bugs related to handling explicit object parameters, especially in contexts where recursion or method chaining is not expected.
