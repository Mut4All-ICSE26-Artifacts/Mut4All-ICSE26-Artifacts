Mutation Operator: Modify Destructor Declaration

Target Code Construct: Class Destructor

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the destructor of a class. It is typically declared in the format `~ClassName() {}` within a class definition.
2. Modify the destructor declaration by changing the braces `{}` to a single semicolon `;`, making it a pure virtual destructor, which may cause the compiler to exhibit unexpected behavior when using certain type traits.
3. Ensure the mutation applies to a class that is subsequently tested with type traits, aiming to challenge the compiler's ability to handle cases where the destructor is not properly defined.

Example Before Mutation:
```
class Example {
    ~Example() {}
};
```

Example After Mutation:
```
class Example {
    ~Example() = 0;
};
```

Note: This operator targets the modification of a destructor to an invalid form, challenging the compiler's robustness in handling type trait evaluations and potentially leading to crashes if not handled correctly.
