Mutation Operator: Static Function Declaration in Anonymous Struct

Target Code Construct: Anonymous structs with static member functions

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate any anonymous struct in the seed program.
2. Introduce a static member function declaration within the anonymous struct.
3. Ensure the function is declared but not defined, using a typical syntax error pattern such as a missing function body or improper syntax to replicate common errors.

Example:

Original Code:
```
struct {
    int memberVar;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct {
    static void functionName; // Step 2: Declare a static function without a definition
    int memberVar;
};
```

Note:
- If there are existing functions in the seed program, use their naming conventions for the static function without creating a definition.
- The mutated code should trigger scenarios where incomplete or improper function declarations may cause the compiler to encounter unexpected conditions, leading to a crash or other unintended behavior.
