Mutation Operator: Export Nested Struct Without Definition

Target Code Construct: Nested Struct in a Module

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that contains a nested struct which is declared but not defined:
   - Example: 
     ```cpp
     struct Outer { struct Inner; };
     ```
   
2. Export the nested struct without providing its definition using a module export statement:
   - Before Mutation:
     ```cpp
     struct Outer { struct Inner; };
     ```
   - After Mutation:
     ```cpp
     export module ExampleModule;
     struct Outer { struct Inner; };
     export struct Outer::Inner {};
     ```

3. Ensure that the surrounding code includes the necessary module and struct declarations:
   - If the outer struct or module does not exist, add a module export statement and an outer struct with a nested struct declaration.

Explanation:
The mutation operator exploits the scenario where a nested struct is declared but not defined, and the program attempts to export this nested struct within a module. This is designed to mimic the bug scenario where the compiler crashes due to invalid handling of such constructs. The mutation is straightforward: it involves adding an export module statement and attempting to export the nested struct without providing its definition. This operator targets the specific behavior observed in the bug report, where exporting a nested struct without a proper definition causes a compiler crash.
