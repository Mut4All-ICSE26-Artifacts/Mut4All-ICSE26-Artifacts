Mutation Operator:

Target Code Construct: Function-like Macros

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function-like macro that has two or more arguments specified, such as `#define MACRO_NAME(arg1, arg2)`.
2. Locate an instance where this macro is invoked without parentheses around any argument that contains an initializer list or a similar complex expression.
3. Mutate the macro invocation by removing the parentheses entirely around one argument that is a braced initializer list or a complex expression.
4. Ensure the mutated macro invocation still maintains a syntactic structure that resembles the original context, creating a scenario similar to the bug report.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
#define ASSERT_EQUAL(val1, val2) some_function(val1, val2)

void testFunction() {
  MyStruct obj = {1, 2};
  ASSERT_EQUAL(obj, MyStruct{3, 4});
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
#define ASSERT_EQUAL(val1, val2) some_function(val1, val2)

void testFunction() {
  MyStruct obj = {1, 2};
  ASSERT_EQUAL(obj, MyStruct{3, 4});
  ASSERT_EQUAL(obj, MyStruct{5, 6}); // Mutated: Remove parentheses around complex argument
}
```

This mutation operator focuses on making changes to macro invocations with initializer lists to mimic scenarios that are likely to trigger similar compiler crashes or incorrect behavior as reported in the bug. The focus is on removing parentheses around arguments with complex structures during macro invocation.
