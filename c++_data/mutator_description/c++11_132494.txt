Mutation Operator: Enum Forward Declaration

Target: Enum declarations, specifically forward-declared enums.

Mutation Rule:

1. Locate an enum that has been forward-declared but not defined. For example:
   
   ```cpp
   enum struct MyEnum;
   ```

2. Modify the code to attempt accessing a value or member from this forward-declared enum without providing a definition. This can involve:
   
   a. Declaring a function or variable that takes a type dependent on the forward-declared enum without defining it. For example, using it in a function template or as a template argument.

   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   void someFunction(typename T::EnumMember);

   someFunction<MyEnum>(0);
   ```

3. Ensure the mutation is such that it leads to an attempt to instantiate or use the incomplete type, which could potentially lead to a compiler assertion failure or crash.

Example:

Original Code:
```cpp
enum struct MyEnum;
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
enum struct MyEnum;

template <typename T>
void someFunction(typename T::EnumMember);

someFunction<MyEnum>(0);
```

Explanation: This mutation targets potential vulnerabilities in the compiler's handling of incomplete types, specifically forward-declared enums, which can lead to assertion failures or crashes when the enum is used as if it's complete.
