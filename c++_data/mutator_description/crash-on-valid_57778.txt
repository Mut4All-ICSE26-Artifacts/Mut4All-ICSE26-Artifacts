Mutation Operator: Modify Module-Related Declarations

Target: Global variable declarations when used with module directives.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a seed program containing global variable declarations that are potentially used in module contexts. In the provided example, this is `int a;`.
2. Introduce the `export` keyword to the global variable declaration to simulate exporting the variable from a module. For example, change `int a;` to `export int a;`.
3. Ensure that the seed program includes a module directive such as `module;` or `export module <module-name>;` at the beginning of the file if not already present. This establishes the program's context as a module.
4. Compile the mutated program with module-related compile flags such as `-std=c++20 -fmodules -Xclang -fmodule-name=<module-name>`.
5. Observe if the mutation leads to unexpected compiler behavior or crashes, particularly focusing on how the frontend handles module code generation.

Note: This mutation operator leverages interactions between C++ module features and global variable declarations, which can be a source of instability in compilers due to the complexity of module support.
