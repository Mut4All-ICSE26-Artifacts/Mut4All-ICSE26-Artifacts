Mutation Operator: Struct Redefinition

Target: Struct definitions

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator involves redefining a struct within the same scope in a way that is likely to trigger a compiler crash.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a struct definition within the code. For example:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
       int a;
   };
   ```

2. Immediately after the first definition of the struct, redefine the same struct within the same scope without any additional declaration or separation. For instance:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
       float b;
   };
   ```

3. Ensure that the redefinition does not use the 'typedef' keyword or any other qualifiers that could legitimize the redefinition. The goal is to provoke an inconsistency in how the struct is understood by the compiler.

Example of Mutation Application:
Original:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    struct Sample {
        int x;
    };
}
```

Mutated:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    struct Sample {
        int x;
    };

    struct Sample {
        float y;
    };
}
```

Rationale: This mutation operator exploits the fact that redefinitions of structs within the same scope can lead to inconsistent internal representations, which might lead to crashes as the compiler tries to resolve these discrepancies. This operator is applied specifically to struct definitions and aims at redefining them in a manner that is syntactically incorrect yet structurally confusing for the compiler.
