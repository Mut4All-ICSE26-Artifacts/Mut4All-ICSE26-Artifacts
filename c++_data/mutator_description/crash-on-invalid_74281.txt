Mutation Operator:
Target: Struct Definitions
This mutation operator targets struct definitions in C++ code, specifically focusing on nested structs and incomplete struct declarations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the code. Within the struct, locate any nested struct definitions or forward declarations of the same struct.

2. Modify the nested struct declaration to create a forward declaration loop. This is done by declaring a nested struct with the same name as the outer struct within its body, without providing a complete definition.

3. Conclude the outer struct definition with an incomplete body by omitting some expected fields or members.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
   int x;
   struct NestedStruct {
      double y;
   };
};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
   int x;
   struct MyStruct; // Forward declaration of a struct with the same name
   struct NestedStruct {
      double y;
   };
}; // Incomplete body of the outer struct
```

This mutation operator creates scenarios that are more likely to trigger parsing errors or ambiguities in the compiler's handling of nested and forward struct declarations. The key is to introduce similar names and incomplete structures to test the compiler's robustness.
