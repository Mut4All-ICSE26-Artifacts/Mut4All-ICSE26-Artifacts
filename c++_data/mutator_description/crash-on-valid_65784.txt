Mutation Operator: Array Initialization with Type Mismatch

Target Construct: Array Initialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing array of structs being initialized with a list of values. Ensure that the array type is appropriately defined and used in the seed program.
2. For each element being used to initialize the array, deliberately mismatch its type with the expected type. For example, if an integer pointer is expected, use a different pointer type.
3. To maintain the syntactic correctness, ensure all values are valid expressions, but mismatched in terms of types.

Example:
Given an existing struct definition and array declaration:
```
struct Example { int *ptr; };
const struct Example array[] = {(int *)(0)};
```
Mutation:
Change the initializer to use a mismatched pointer type:
```
const struct Example array[] = {(float *)(0)};
```
This mutation introduces a type mismatch between the expected `int` pointer and an `float` pointer, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or a compiler crash.
