Mutation Operator: Alias Template with Nested Templates

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets the use of alias templates, particularly those involving nested template types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an alias template in the code. An alias template typically has the form `template<typename T> using AliasName = SomeTemplate<T>;`.
2. Modify the existing alias template to introduce an additional level of template nesting. This involves wrapping the existing type with another template, effectively creating a nested template structure within the alias.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template<typename T>
using AliasType = SomeTemplate<T>;
```

Mutated Code:
```
template<typename T>
struct Wrapper {
    using type = SomeTemplate<T>;
};

template<typename T>
using AliasType = Wrapper<T>::type;
```

Application:
- The mutation specifically applies to alias templates and involves the introduction of an additional layer of templates.
- This transformation increases the complexity of the template instantiation chain, which can potentially expose issues related to template deduction and alias handling in the compiler.

Rationale:
This mutation operator is designed to increase the complexity of template aliasing by introducing nested template structures. Such nesting can lead to more intricate interactions during template instantiation and deduction, thereby increasing the likelihood of triggering bugs related to template handling in the compiler. The goal is to stress-test the compiler's ability to process and resolve deeply nested template aliases.
