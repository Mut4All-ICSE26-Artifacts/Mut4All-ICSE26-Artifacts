Mutation Operator: Modify Flexible Array Member in Struct

Target: Struct with a flexible array member

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with a flexible array member. Example:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
     int identifier;
     char data[];
   };
   ```

2. Add a regular array as a member before the flexible array member. This introduces an element with a fixed size that may affect memory layout or initialization rules. Modify the struct as follows:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
     int identifier;
     char buffer[10];
     char data[];
   };
   ```

3. Ensure that any existing initializations or uses of the struct are compatible with the new buffer member. Update usage in the code to accommodate the additional member.

This mutation operator leverages the structural complexity introduced by flexible array members in combination with regular arrays, which can lead to issues in the compiler's handling of memory layout, initialization, or other internal processes.
