Mutation Operator: Modify Static Member Functions with 'this' in Exception Specification

1. Target: Static member functions in template classes, specifically the exception specification part of the function.

2. Mutation Rule:
   - Identify a static member function within a templated struct or class that employs an exception specification such as noexcept.
   - If the exception specification involves any expressions using 'this', replace 'this' with an expression that is invalid in the context of a static member function (e.g., accessing a non-static member or function directly without an instance).
   - For instance, change:
     ```cpp
     struct Templated {
       static void example() noexcept(noexcept(this->nonStaticFunc()));
     };
     ```
     to:
     ```cpp
     struct Templated {
       static void example() noexcept(noexcept(instance.nonStaticFunc()));
     };
     ```
   - Ensure that 'instance' is an undeclared identifier or an invalid reference not recognized in the context of a static member function.

3. Steps to Apply:
   - Locate a static function in a template class structure.
   - Verify that the function uses an exception specification, such as noexcept.
   - Check if 'this' is used within the noexcept expression.
   - Replace 'this' with an inappropriate reference or variable (like a non-existent or non-static member) that would generate an error.
   - Compile the program to check if the mutation triggers unexpected compiler behavior or crashes.

4. Example:
   Original Code:
   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   struct Example {
     static void func() noexcept(noexcept(this->memberFunction()));
   };
   ```

   Mutated Code:
   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   struct Example {
     static void func() noexcept(noexcept(instance.memberFunction()));
   };
   ```
   Here, 'instance' is not defined, leading to invalid use within the static member function's exception specification.
