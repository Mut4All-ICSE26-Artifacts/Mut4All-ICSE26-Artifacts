Mutation Operator: Modify Template Deduction Guide in Headers

Target Construct:
Template deduction guides in header files.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a template deduction guide in a header file. This is usually a 'template' directive followed by an expression using '->'. An example from the report is: `template<class T, class U> bar(T, U) -> bar<T, U>;`.
2. Alter the deduction guide by changing the template parameter types or order. For instance, if the original guide is `template<class T, class U> bar(T, U) -> bar<T, U>;`, mutate it to `template<class T, class U> bar(T, U) -> bar<U, T>;`.
3. Ensure the mutation still uses only the existing template parameters and types within the file. Do not introduce new types or parameters that aren't already declared.
4. Save the changes and ensure the header is included in a module or source file to trigger the compiler behavior.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
// Original deduction guide
template<class T, class U> bar(T, U) -> bar<T, U>;
```

After Mutation:
```
// Modified deduction guide
template<class T, class U> bar(T, U) -> bar<U, T>;
```

Note:
This mutation operator focuses on altering the behavior of template deduction guides, which are structures known to trigger issues during module merging and compilation, as seen in the bug report. This method ensures that mutations are likely to affect the compiler's deduction mechanisms, thereby increasing the chance of encountering similar assert failures or crashes.
