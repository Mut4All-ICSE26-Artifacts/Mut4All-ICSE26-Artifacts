Mutation Operator: Misplaced or Missing Commas in Requires Clauses

Target Code Construct: Requires Clause in Templates and Concepts

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template or a concept that includes a `requires` clause with a series of expressions or requirements.
2. Introduce a missing comma by removing an existing comma between two elements within the `requires` clause.
3. Alternatively, add an unnecessary comma in place of a logical operator or between expressions where it is not syntactically valid.
4. Ensure that the mutation applies to `requires` clauses within templates or concepts, causing syntactical ambiguity.

Example of Mutation:
Given a seed program segment with a requires clause:
```
template<class T>
concept MyConcept = requires(T t) { 
    t.method1(), t.method2(); 
};
```
Apply mutation by removing a comma:
```
template<class T>
concept MyConcept = requires(T t) { 
    t.method1() t.method2(); 
};
```
This mutation removes the comma, potentially causing parsing issues for the compiler. Ensure that the clause still has a logical structure, so the compiler attempts to process it, leading to possible crashes.
