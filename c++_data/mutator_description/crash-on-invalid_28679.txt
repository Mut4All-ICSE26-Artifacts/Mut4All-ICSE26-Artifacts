Mutation Operator: Template Function Instantiation with Ambiguous Return Type

Target Code Construct: Template Functions with Lambda Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function that accepts a parameter of any type `T` and includes a lambda expression.
2. Inside the lambda expression, modify the return type to utilize `decltype` with an expression or statement that is not directly related to `T` or any returnable value. This should be achieved by using a function or operation, such as assigning a variable to a non-void function without calling it.
3. Ensure that the lambda expression is structured in such a way that it lacks a call to the expression/function used in `decltype`, thus making the return type ambiguous.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template <typename T>
void exampleFunction(T param) {
    [](int x) -> decltype(someOperation) {
    };
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
template <typename T>
void exampleFunction(T param) {
    [](int x) -> decltype(abort) {  // `abort` is declared but not called
    };
}
```

Explanation:
- The mutation targets a lambda expression within a template function.
- The return type of the lambda is defined using `decltype` with a function like `abort` that is declared but not executed within the lambda.
- This mutation operator exploits the compiler's type deduction mechanism, potentially causing it to incorrectly handle templates with ambiguous or unresolved types, particularly when the lambda is not properly formed or its return type is invalid or non-void.
