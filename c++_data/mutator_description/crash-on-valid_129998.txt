Mutation Operator:

Target: Template Alias and Template Argument Deduction

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate the use of a `using` declaration that involves a template alias (e.g., `using constant = std::integral_constant<decltype(Value), Value>;`).
2. Introduce an additional template parameter that utilizes automatic deduction (e.g., `auto` keyword) or relies on a complex expression that is not immediately deducible. This can potentially create ambiguity in template argument deduction.
3. Replace a straightforward use of a template alias in an expression with a more complex expression that relies on deduction from a nested template instantiation.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <auto Value>
using constant = std::integral_constant<decltype(Value), Value>;

constant<42> myConstant;
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <auto Value>
using constant = std::integral_constant<decltype(Value), Value>;

template <typename T>
using complexConstant = constant<sizeof(T) + Value>;

complexConstant<int> myComplexConstant;
```

This mutation leverages the complexity of template argument deduction by introducing expressions that involve type-dependent computations, which might lead to unexpected behaviors in the compiler's deduction mechanisms.
