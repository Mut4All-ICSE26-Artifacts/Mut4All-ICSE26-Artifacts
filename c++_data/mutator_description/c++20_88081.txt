Mutation Operator
Target: Function Parameters with Concepts

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function that uses concepts in its parameter list, specifically one that includes a 'requires' clause or a concept-based constraint.
2. Modify the parameter list to include an additional statement using an existing or new variable that mimics a concept constraint but uses invalid or ambiguous syntax expected to challenge the compiler's parser.
3. Ensure this modification is syntactically valid in its context but semantically ambiguous or complex enough to potentially trigger a parsing bug.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template<typename T>
void func(T param) requires SomeConcept<T> {
    // function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
template<typename T>
void func(T param) requires (SomeConcept<T> && requires () { decltype(param)(); }) {
    // function body
}
```

Description:
This mutation operator targets the function parameter list that uses C++20 concepts. By adding an additional 'requires' clause with another layer of 'requires' within it, using a lambda expression or decltype, we introduce a complex parsing situation. This mutation takes advantage of the intricacies in concept expression parsing, which is known to cause issues based on the bug report provided. The mutation aims to trigger errors in the compiler's ability to handle nested and complex constraint syntax.
