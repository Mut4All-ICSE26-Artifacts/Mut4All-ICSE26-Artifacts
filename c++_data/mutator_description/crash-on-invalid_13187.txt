Mutation Operator: Modify Complex Type Declaration with Transparent Union

Target Code Construct: Typedefs and Union Declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a typedef that uses a union as its base type, particularly involving the `__attribute__((__transparent_union__))` attribute.
2. Modify the internal structure of the typedef to include forward declarations or incomplete types.

Steps:
a. Locate a typedef declaration with a union type, for example:
   typedef union { union InnerType memberVar; } MyUnionType __attribute__((__transparent_union__));
b. Alter the union to reference another union or struct that is only forward-declared within it. For instance:
   - Before Mutation: typedef union { union InnerType memberVar; } MyUnionType;
   - Introduce a forward-declared union within the typedef:
     typedef union { union ForwardDeclaredType memberVar; } MyUnionType;
     // Add a new forward declaration at the appropriate scope
     union ForwardDeclaredType;

Explanation:
- This mutation introduces a forward declaration within a union used in a typedef with the transparent union attribute. The purpose is to examine how the compiler handles incomplete types within transparent union constructs, potentially leading to assertion errors when the layout of the types is requested by the compiler.
- Use existing types or unions present in the program and ensure that any new types (e.g., `ForwardDeclaredType`) are properly forward-declared to maintain the structure's validity.
