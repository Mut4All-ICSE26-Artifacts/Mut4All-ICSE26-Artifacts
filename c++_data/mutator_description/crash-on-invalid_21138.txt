Mutation Operator: Modify Template Conversion Function

Target: Template conversion operators within class templates.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a class template `C` that defines a conversion operator template with the syntax `template <typename T> operator T();`.

2. Within the same class template `C`, locate a member function definition, either within the class definition or outside using scope resolution.

3. In the identified member function, replace or insert a call to the conversion operator. For example, change an expression like `0, operator int();` to `operator T1();` where `T1` is a type that is not associated with any operation in the function context or is unrelated to the template parameter of the conversion operator.

4. Ensure that the type `T1` is a valid type in the program's context but intentionally unrelated to the intended usage, creating a potential mismatch for template deduction.

5. Repeat this process for any other conversion operators within the same class template or similar class templates.

Example (pseudo-code form):

Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename U> struct B {
   template <typename T> operator T();
   void g();
};

template <typename U>
void B<U>::g() {
   0, operator int(); // Original expression
}
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename U> struct B {
   template <typename T> operator T();
   void g();
};

template <typename U>
void B<U>::g() {
   operator double(); // Modified expression leading to potential compiler crash
}
```
