Mutation Operator: Enum with Forward Declaration

Target Code Construct: Enum definition with forward declaration involving types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing enum forward declaration within the codebase.
2. Ensure that the forward-declared enum is referenced in a context where its complete definition is required, but it has not been defined yet.
3. Modify the existing code to introduce this forward declaration scenario, if not already present:
   - Locate a function or class that references the incomplete enum type.
   - Insert a reference to the incomplete enum, such as using it as a parameter type or return type in a function signature.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
// Existing forward declaration of an enum
enum IncompleteEnum;

// Function using a different type
void process(int value);
```

Modified Code:
```cpp
// Forward declaration of an enum
enum IncompleteEnum;

// Reference the incomplete enum in the function signature
void process(IncompleteEnum value);
```

The mutation encourages scenarios where the compiler attempts to use an incomplete enum type, potentially triggering a crash when it expects a completed definition. This mutation operator can be adapted to various seed programs by identifying where incomplete types might be inadvertently used.
