Mutation Operator: Compound Literal with Embedded Resource

Target Code Construct: Compound Literal in conjunction with resource embedding

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any existing compound literals within the provided seed program. These are typically of the form: `(type){initializer}`.
2. Modify the compound literal by embedding a resource directly within it, similar to the use of `#embed`. However, due to restrictions on replicating the exact bug, simulate the concept of embedding by using a static array, initialized with values that simulate a resource.
3. Convert the compound literal to a static array initialization. This involves:
   a. Declaring a new static array with the same type as the original compound literal.
   b. Initializing this new static array with an equivalent initializer or a simple byte sequence.
   c. Modify the original compound literal to reference this array instead of embedding directly within the compound literal.

Example:
Original Code:
```
int *array = (int[]){1, 2, 3};
```

Mutated Content:
```
static int resource[] = {1, 2, 3};  // Declare a static array simulating a resource
int *array = resource;             // Reference the static array instead of a compound literal
```

This mutation operator targets scenarios where compound literals are used in contexts that might be prone to issues when combined with unusual initializers or resource embeddings, as seen in the bug report. The static array simulates resource embedding and can trigger similar compiler behavior while ensuring the program remains valid.
