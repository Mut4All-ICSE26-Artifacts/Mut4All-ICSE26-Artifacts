Mutation Operator: Insert Invalid Preprocessor Directive

Target Code Construct: Preprocessor directives within an array or a data structure declaration.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a location within an existing array or data structure declaration where a preprocessor directive could be embedded. This could be anywhere a valid directive like `#include` or `#define` might appear, such as within an initializer list.
2. Insert an invalid or nonsensical preprocessor directive. The directive should start with a valid preprocessor command (e.g., `#embed`, `#include`), but follow it with nonsensical or unexpected parameters, such as a random sequence of characters or invalid parameters that do not conform to the expected syntax or parameter list of the directive.
3. Ensure the directive is syntactically correct in terms of being a directive, meaning it should begin with `#` and follow the rules of preprocessor directives, but the parameters following it should be deliberately incorrect.

Example:
Consider an existing array declaration in the seed program:
```
int arr[] = {1, 2, 3};
```
Apply the mutation by embedding a faulty preprocessor directive:
```
int arr[] = {
    #embed __FILE__ nonsense(10) limit(2)
};
```
Explanation:
- The directive `#embed` is introduced within the body of the array initializer.
- The parameters provided to `#embed` are deliberately nonsensical or incorrect (e.g., `nonsense(10)`), which is intended to trigger a compiler bug due to invalid preprocessor syntax handling or unexpected tokens.
- This operator focuses on both the structural position (inside data structures) and the syntactic structure (use of preprocessor directives) to exploit potential bugs in directive parsing and handling.
