Mutation Operator: Pointer to Member Mutation

Target Code Construct: Member Pointers in Structs or Classes

Mutation Rule:
- The mutation operator targets situations where pointers to members are used within a class or struct. The mutation involves introducing a scenario where the compiler might have to validate the type of the member pointer and ensure it is not a placeholder type, potentially triggering edge cases in type checking.
- Specifically, modify the use of member pointers within function calls or expressions to potentially misalign expected operations, creating an invalid state that can test the robustness of the compiler's type and assertion checks.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a class or struct with at least one member variable.
   Example:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
       int memberVar;
   };
   ```

2. Declare a pointer to member within the struct or class and initialize it using &ClassName::MemberVar.
   Example:
   ```
   int MyStruct::* ptrToMember = &MyStruct::memberVar;
   ```

3. Introduce a function that takes the struct or class as an argument and performs an operation using the pointer to member.
   Original:
   ```
   void processStruct(MyStruct &obj) {
       int value = obj.*ptrToMember;
   }
   ```

4. Mutate the operation by deliberately misplacing or mismatching the member access, such as attempting to use the pointer to member on a class type that is not compatible.
   Mutation:
   ```
   void processStruct(MyStruct &obj, AnotherStruct &anotherObj) {
       int value = anotherObj.*ptrToMember;  // Misplaced usage
   }
   ```

5. Ensure the mutated code uses variables and types already declared in the existing seed program, modifying only the interactions and usage patterns to potentially expose compiler bugs related to type checking and pointer validation.

This mutation operator is designed to explore edge cases involving pointers to member variables, typically leading to assertion failures or crashes if the compiler's type verification mechanisms are not robust enough.
