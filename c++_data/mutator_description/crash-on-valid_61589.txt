Mutation Operator: Modify Template Specialization Conditions

Target Code Construct: Template specialization of structs or classes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify template specializations in the code which are conditional, i.e., they rely on certain conditions being met for specialization.
2. Introduce an intermediate struct or class to be used as a parameter in the specialization condition.
3. Replace the direct use of types or conditions in the template specialization with the newly introduced intermediate struct or class.
4. Apply this change in areas where template specialization is being used to trigger the specialization condition.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T, typename F, typename S>
inline constexpr bool callbale_with_nth_parameter_being_expand = false;

template<typename T, typename F, typename S>
inline constexpr bool callbale_with_nth_parameter_being_expand<
    T, F,
    specialize<S>
> = callable<
    F,
    T
>;
```

Mutated Content:
1. Introduce an intermediate struct or class, e.g., `struct intermediate { using type = S; };`.
2. Modify the specialization condition to use this intermediate structure.
```cpp
template<typename T, typename F, typename S>
inline constexpr bool callbale_with_nth_parameter_being_expand = false;

template<typename T, typename F, typename S>
inline constexpr bool callbale_with_nth_parameter_being_expand<
    T, F,
    intermediate
> = callable<
    F,
    typename intermediate::type
>;
```

Note: The intermediate struct or class should be properly declared and used within the specialization condition to ensure the specialization logic remains valid but altered enough to explore compiler behavior under different internal conditions.
