Mutation Operator: Modify User-Defined Conversion Operator

Target Code Construct: User-Defined Conversion Operator in a Struct

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a user-defined conversion operator within a struct. This operator should have the form `operator Type()`.
2. Modify the return type of this conversion operator to a type that is incompatible with the operations performed in the body of the operator function.
3. Ensure that the new return type can potentially cause an invalid or undefined operation when used in expressions involving the original return type.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    operator int() {
        return 42;
    }
};
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Locate the user-defined conversion operator `operator int()`.
2. Change the return type from `int` to a pointer type, e.g., `int*`.

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    operator int*() {
        return nullptr; // Must change the return statement accordingly
    }
};
```

Notes:
- The return statement inside the conversion operator must be adjusted to return a compatible type with the new return type (e.g., `nullptr` for pointers).
- This operator mutation can lead to issues when the conversion is used in expressions that expect the original type, potentially triggering bugs in the compiler's handling of conversion expressions.
