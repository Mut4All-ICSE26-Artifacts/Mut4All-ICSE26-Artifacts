Mutation Operator: Unfinished Struct Declaration

Target: Struct Declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct declaration in the source code. It should be a complete declaration or definition.
2. Introduce an unfinished struct declaration within the existing struct definition.
3. To perform the mutation:
   - Choose an existing struct declaration within a function or at global scope.
   - Inside this struct, introduce a new struct declaration without a body, making it an incomplete type.
   - Ensure the new struct is nested within the existing struct.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct A {
    int x;
    float y;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct A {
    int x;
    float y;
    struct B; // Introduce an incomplete struct declaration
};
```

Explanation:
The mutation involves adding an unfinished struct declaration inside another struct. This mutation is likely to expose how the compiler handles incomplete type declarations and struct nesting, potentially leading to edge cases that may trigger crashes, especially when the incomplete struct is used further in the code. This operator leverages existing structures and sticks to standard C++ syntax, making it broadly applicable to various code bases.
