Mutation Operator: Invalid Function Declaration Inside Class

Target Code Construct: Class Declaration

Detailed Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class within the seed program.
2. Inside the class body, insert an invalid function declaration that could potentially confuse the parser. Specifically, do not provide a return type for the function.
3. Ensure that the function name does not conflict with existing member functions or variables within the class.
4. Ensure the malformed function is declared within the class body, not in the global scope or outside the class. 
5. Do not define the function body; only provide a declaration.

Example before mutation:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void existingFunction();
};
```

Example after mutation:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    void existingFunction();
    newFunction(); // Invalid function declaration without a return type
};
```

Note: The mutation operator aims to exploit parser misinterpretations when encountering incomplete or malformed declarations inside class bodies. This operator avoids introducing new types or variables outside the scope of the existing structure.
