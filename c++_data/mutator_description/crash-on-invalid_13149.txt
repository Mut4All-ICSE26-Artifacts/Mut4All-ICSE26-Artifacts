Mutation Operator: Modify Template Class Specialization

Target Construct: Template class specialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class specialization in the code. In the provided example, it is the line `template<typename _CharT, typename _Traits = char_traits<_CharT> > class basic_ios;`.
2. Introduce a new specialization for the template class that omits a default template argument, or incorrectly specifies the type of the template parameter.
3. Ensure the new specialization is within the same translation unit and does not have a corresponding class definition.

Example Pseudo-Code:
Original Code:
```
template<class _CharT> struct char_traits;
template<typename _CharT, typename _Traits = char_traits<_CharT> > class basic_ios;
```

Mutation:
```
template<> class basic_ios<int, void>;  // Introduced a specialization with 'void' type, which doesn't have a definition
```

Details:
- The mutation introduces a specialization `basic_ios<int, void>` that lacks a definition.
- Here, the second template parameter `_Traits` is explicitly specified as `void`, which is unusual and lacks a matching definition.
- This kind of mutation can challenge the compiler's assumptions about template instantiations and their definitions, potentially eliciting assertion failures or crashes if not gracefully handled.
