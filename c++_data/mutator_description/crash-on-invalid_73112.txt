Mutation Operator: Misplaced Requires Clause in Function Body

Target Code Construct: Function Body

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition in the seed program, preferably a simple function like `int func() { ... }`.
2. Introduce a `requires` clause within the function body, which is syntactically incorrect in this context. For example, immediately inside the function's braces.
3. Ensure the `requires` clause has incorrect syntax to simulate malformed code, such as missing a complete condition or improper termination.

Example:
Original Code:
```
int calculate() {
    int result = 0;
    // Perform calculations here
    return result;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
int calculate() {
    requires { requires int; } // Misplaced and malformed requires clause
    int result = 0;
    // Perform calculations here
    return result;
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator places a malformed `requires` clause inside a function body, which is not valid according to C++20 specifications. The clause is intended to cause the parser to encounter unexpected tokens, thus potentially triggering a crash similar to the bug report scenario. This mutation has high coverage because it exploits the compiler's handling of C++20 concepts and their syntactic expectations.
