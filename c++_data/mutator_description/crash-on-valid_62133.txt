Mutation Operator: Universal Character Name in Identifier Declaration

Target Construct:
The target construct for this mutation operator is identifier declarations within functions, structs, classes, or global scopes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate an identifier declaration in the code, such as a variable or function name.
2. Replace a portion of the identifier with a universal character name. Ensure that the universal character name corresponds to a valid Unicode character that is legal in C++ identifiers.
3. If the identifier is part of a function, ensure that all references to the identifier are updated consistently to use the universal character name.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a variable or function declaration. Example:
   - Original: `int myVariable;`
2. Choose a valid part of the identifier to replace with a universal character name. Example replacement could be replacing 'V' in `myVariable` with `\u0056`.
3. Apply the change: 
   - Modified: `int my\u0056ariable;`
4. Update all usages of this identifier in the code to ensure consistency. Example:
   - Original usage: `myVariable = 10;`
   - Modified usage: `my\u0056ariable = 10;`

Rationale:
This mutation operator exploits the handling of universal character names in identifiers, an area that might lead to parsing or internal representation issues in the compiler. By introducing universal character names, the mutation can potentially trigger bugs related to character encoding, symbol tables, or name resolution, especially if the compiler's handling of such Unicode escapes is faulty.
