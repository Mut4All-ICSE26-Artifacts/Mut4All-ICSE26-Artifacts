Based on the provided bug report, it seems that C++ compiler bugs are more likely to trigger in scenarios involving:

1. Class hierarchies with base classes.
2. Dereferencing potentially null pointers in relation to base class declarations.
3. Operations on class/record layouts, especially when determining sizes of empty subobjects.

Considering these observations, the mutation operator that could more effectively cause C++ compiler bugs might involve manipulating class hierarchies and empty base class declarations. Here is a mutation operator targeting this:

Mutation Operator: Null Base Class Dereference

Target: Class/Struct with Base Classes

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class that inherits from one or more base classes.
2. In the base class list of the identified class, introduce a new base class that is declared but not defined. This can simulate a null pointer scenario when the compiler tries to access information about the base class.
3. Ensure that this new base class is added alongside existing base classes, without replacing them.

Example in Pseudo-code:
- Original Code:
  ```cpp
  class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
      // Member declarations
  };
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```cpp
  class UndefinedBase; // Declaration without definition
  
  class Derived : public Base1, public Base2, public UndefinedBase {
      // Member declarations
  };
  ```

This mutation operator capitalizes on potential compiler weaknesses in handling incomplete type information and base class access, potentially leading to null pointer dereferences during compilation.
