Based on the provided bug report, the crash is associated with the use of integer values that are not representable by `int64_t`. This indicates that issues may be triggered by operations or functions involving integer type conversions or limits.

Mutation Operator:
- Target: Function calls involving integer parameters
- Mutation Rule: Identify a function call that takes integer arguments. Replace one of the integer arguments with a negative large integer value that is typically out of range for standard 32-bit signed integers. Ensure the value used is explicitly a `long long` by appending `LL`.

Example:
Original code snippet:
```
int result = someFunction(42, anotherVar, 1000);
```

Mutation:
1. Identify the integer argument in a function call.
2. Replace the chosen integer argument with `-9223372036854775808LL`, ensuring it is a `long long` type that exceeds the `int64_t` representability.
3. Ensure that the function signature and behavior can logically accept a `long long` type value.

Mutated example:
```
int result = someFunction(42, anotherVar, -9223372036854775808LL);
```

This mutation operator focuses on the boundary values of integer types used in function calls, potentially revealing issues in type handling within the compiler.
