Mutation Operator: Packed Struct with Template Function

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets packed structs and modifies how template functions interact within such structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with the `__attribute__((packed))` attribute in the existing seed program.
2. Within this struct, locate a member function template. If no such function exists, introduce a new template function within the struct.
3. Modify the template function so that it includes an operation that casts a member variable to the template type `T`.
4. Ensure this operation attempts to use the casted variable in a non-trivial manner, such as invoking a method or accessing a member.

Example Before Mutation:
```
struct __attribute__((packed)) MyStruct {
    unsigned options;
    template <typename T> void processOptions() {
        (T*)&options;
    }
};
```

Example After Mutation:
```
struct __attribute__((packed)) MyStruct {
    unsigned options;
    template <typename T> void processOptions() {
        T* optPtr = (T*)&options;
        optPtr->someMethod(); // Assuming T has a method named someMethod
    }
};
```

Note:
- If `T` does not have `someMethod`, replace it with a generic operation that assumes `T` has some known member or behavior.
- The above mutation makes assumptions that may cause the compiler to crash or exhibit undefined behavior when it cannot correctly handle the operations involving packed structs and template functions.
