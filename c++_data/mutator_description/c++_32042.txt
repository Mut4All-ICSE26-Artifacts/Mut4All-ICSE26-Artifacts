Mutation Operator: Static Const Template Member Removal

Target: Template Class with Static Const Member

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator targets template classes that contain static const member variables. The idea is to remove the static const declaration and observe if the compiler retains stability or crashes. This can help identify weak points in the compiler regarding static const template handling.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a template class in the source code. For example:

   ```
   template<typename T>
   class Example {
   public:
       static const int value = 42;
   };
   ```

2. Locate the static const member within the template class. In this example, it is `static const int value`.

3. Remove the static const declaration entirely from the template class. The modified code will look like this:

   ```
   template<typename T>
   class Example {
   public:
       // static const int value = 42; // This line is removed
   };
   ```

4. Recompile the code to observe if the removal leads to unexpected compiler behavior, such as a crash or incorrect compilation results.

This mutation operator can be applied to any template class with static const members and is designed to test the compiler's ability to handle such constructs when altered. The modification should be performed using existing code constructs, ensuring the removal process is clear and unambiguous.
