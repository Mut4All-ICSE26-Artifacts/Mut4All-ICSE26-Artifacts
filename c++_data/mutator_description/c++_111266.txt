Mutation Operator: Member Function Template Specialization

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets member function templates within class templates, specifically focusing on explicit specializations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template that contains a member function template with explicit specialization.
2. Modify the explicit specialization by either:
   a. Changing the specialized template argument to a different constant value or type.
   b. Adding additional template parameters to the specialization that were not present in the original member function template declaration.
3. Ensure that any changes in specialization are syntactically correct and respect the C++ language rules regarding specializations and template parameters.
4. If the explicit specialization uses `this` pointer or any member variables, ensure that the usage remains valid or adjust accordingly based on the new specialization parameters.

Example Change:
Original:
```cpp
template<class T> struct B {
  template<int N> auto bar();
  template<> auto bar<2>() {
    return [](auto y) { return y; };
  }
};
template struct B<double>;
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template<class T> struct B {
  template<int N> auto bar();
  template<> auto bar<3>() { // Changed the specialized argument from 2 to 3
    return [](auto y) { return y; };
  }
  template<> auto bar<-1>() { // Added an additional specialization for a different constant
    return [](auto y) { return y * 2; };
  }
};
template struct B<double>;
```

Rationale: This mutation operator is designed to exploit potential weaknesses in handling member function template specializations. By altering the specialization arguments or adding new ones, it tests the compiler's ability to correctly manage explicit specializations and their interactions within class templates. This can surface bugs related to template resolution, name lookup, and code generation for specialized templates.
