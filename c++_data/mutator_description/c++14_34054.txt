Mutation Operator: Default Lambda Argument Modification in Generic Lambda

Target Code Construct: Generic Lambda Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a generic lambda expression in the code. A generic lambda is characterized by the use of 'auto' in its parameter list, indicating that the lambda can accept arguments of any type.

2. Check if the lambda has default arguments. If not, add a default argument to one of its parameters. If it already has a default argument, modify the default argument to a different value or expression.

3. Ensure that the default argument is a lambda expression itself. This creates a scenario similar to the reported bug, where a lambda expression with default arguments is used as a parameter to another lambda.

4. Make sure the default lambda expression does not perform any operations that cause immediate undefined behavior. However, it should contain a simple operation or a return statement that is valid and does not depend on external variables.

Example Transformation:
Original Code:
```cpp
auto myLambda = [](auto x) { return x + 1; };
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
auto myLambda = [](auto x = []() { return 42; }) { return x() + 1; };
```

Explanation:
- The original generic lambda takes a parameter 'x' of any type.
- The mutation adds a default argument 'x', which is itself a lambda returning an integer.
- This mutation tests the compiler's ability to handle nested lambda expressions with default arguments, potentially triggering the bug scenario described in the report.
