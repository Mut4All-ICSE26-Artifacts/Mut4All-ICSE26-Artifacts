Mutation Operator: Alter Use of Whitespace in Expressions

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets expressions within functions, specifically focusing on the use of whitespace around operators and operands.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate an expression within a function definition that involves binary operators (e.g., +, -, *, /).
2. Introduce or remove whitespace inconsistently around the operators and operands to potentially create parsing difficulties. 
3. Example:
   - Original: `int result = a + b;`
   - Mutated: `int result =a+b ;`
4. Ensure that the variables (`a` and `b` in this case) are already declared in the function or scope where this expression resides. If they are not declared, choose existing variables from the same scope to form the expression.
5. Apply the change uniformly across the chosen expression to ensure that the whitespace alterations are consistent.

This mutation operator exploits potential parsing issues related to whitespace handling in compiler frontends, which may lead to assertion failures or crashes when processing invalid code. By focusing on expressions and binary operators, this approach maximizes coverage as such constructs are common in C++ source code.
