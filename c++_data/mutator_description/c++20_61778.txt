Mutation Operator

Target Code Construct: Template Function Overloads with Constraints

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class or struct that contains overloaded member functions. At least one overload should have a constraint using a concept.
2. If no such template exists, introduce a simple template class/struct with two overloaded member functions where one overload is constrained by a concept.
3. Modify the explicit instantiation declaration of a member function to match an unconstrained overload, but introduce an additional constrained overload in the template.
4. Ensure the constrained overload uses a condition that doesn't apply to the explicitly instantiated type, potentially causing ambiguity in overload resolution.

Step-by-step Example:
Original:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = __is_class(T);

template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f() { }
    void f() requires C<T> { }
};

template void S<int>::f();
```

Mutation:
1. Add a new constrained overload to the template:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept D = sizeof(T) > 4;

template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f() { }
    void f() requires C<T> { }
    void f() requires D<T> { }  // New constrained overload
};
```

2. Modify explicit instantiation and invoke with a type that does not satisfy the new constraint but has potential overload resolution ambiguity:
```cpp
template void S<int>::f();  // 'int' does not satisfy 'D<int>'
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator leverages the interaction between constrained template overloads and explicit instantiation. It introduces a new overload with constraints that could conflict with existing overloads, particularly when an explicit instantiation might not directly satisfy the new constraint, aiming to trigger complex overload resolution mechanisms in the compiler.
