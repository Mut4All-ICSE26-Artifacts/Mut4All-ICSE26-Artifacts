Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Definitions.

Mutation Rule: Introduce a malformed doc comment in the function definition that attempts to reference a concept or type in an unsupported context.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a function definition in the source code.
2. Before the function definition, add a documentation comment.
3. In the comment, attempt to use a placeholder or reference marker (e.g., `@something`) that typically refers to code elements, but do so outside of the appropriate context (such as referring to a class member or concept in a function-level comment).
4. Ensure that the reference is syntactically incorrect for the location where it is placed, similar to the misplaced `@doc.self` in the bug report.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
/// Satisfies the [`Add<@example.self>`](example::Add) concept.
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Note: The `@example.self` in the comment is intended to mimic the malformed comment causing an error in the provided bug report, which disrupts the parsing or semantic analysis phase of compilation.
