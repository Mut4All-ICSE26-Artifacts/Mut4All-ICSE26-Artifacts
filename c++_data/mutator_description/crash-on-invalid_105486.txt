Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any function in the provided seed program.
2. Modify the function to include undefined or nonsensical pointer operations that can confuse the compiler, akin to dereferencing an invalid address or null pointer.
3. Specifically, add a line inside the function that attempts to dereference a null pointer, for example, by defining a pointer initialized to zero and then dereferencing it.
4. Ensure that the rest of the function remains unchanged and valid to isolate the mutation's impact on the compiler's evaluation of expressions.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int x = 10;
    // Some other operations
}
```

After Mutation:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int x = 10;
    int* ptr = 0;  // Define a null pointer
    int val = *ptr; // Dereference the null pointer, which is invalid
    // Some other operations
}
```
Explanation:
This mutation introduces an invalid operation by dereferencing a null pointer within the function. This can trigger compiler bugs related to expression evaluation and error handling processes, which are often susceptible to improper pointer operations. The mutation focuses on causing the compiler to crash by inserting an evident logic flaw that compilers might not handle robustly.
