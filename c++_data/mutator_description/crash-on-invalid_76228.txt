Mutation Operator: Incomplete Function Definition in Class/Struct

Target: Class or Struct Definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct in the seed program.
2. Add a new member function declaration within the class or struct without providing a complete definition. The function should have a parameter list but no body.
3. Ensure that the function declaration is syntactically correct in terms of parameter types and return type, but deliberately omit the function body to cause an incomplete definition.
4. This incomplete definition should be placed within the class or struct, directly affecting the member functions' completeness.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```
struct MyStruct {
    int x;
    void completeFunction() {
        // function body
    }
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct MyStruct {
    int x;
    void completeFunction() {
        // function body
    }
    void incompleteFunction(int y);
};
```

In this mutation, the function `incompleteFunction` is declared within the struct `MyStruct` but lacks a definition. The absence of a function body is intended to induce a crash or assertion failure in the compiler, especially when it attempts operations such as member function lookups or special member function generation on the struct, similar to the behavior observed in the bug report.
