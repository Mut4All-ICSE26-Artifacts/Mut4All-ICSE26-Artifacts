Based on the bug report, C++ compiler issues are often triggered by specific structures such as constrained templates, template argument deduction, and function instantiation. The analysis indicates that targeting templates, especially with constraints or concepts, poses a risk for triggering compiler crashes. Here is a mutation operator designed to exploit these areas:

Mutation Operator:
Target Construct: Template Function with Constraints.
Application: This operator applies to a template function that uses C++20 concepts or constraints.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function with constraints, such as `template<typename T> requires SomeConcept<T>`.
2. Modify the constraint to introduce a logical operator that combines multiple concepts, e.g., `requires SomeConcept<T> && AnotherConcept<T>`.
3. In the function body, call a standard library function known for causing issues when used within constrained templates, such as `std::format`.
4. Ensure the template is instantiated with types that meet the modified constraints.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T> requires SomeConcept<T>
void process(const T& value) {
    // Function body
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T> requires (SomeConcept<T> && AnotherConcept<T>)
void process(const T& value) {
    // Introduce a call to std::format, which is known to expose compiler issues
    auto result = std::format("{}", value);
}
```

This mutation introduces an additional layer of complexity in template constraints, which increases the likelihood of exposing compiler instabilities related to template instantiation and concept satisfaction.
