Mutation Operator: Modify Use of Lambda Expressions in Default Arguments

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets lambda expressions used as default arguments in function declarations, specifically when the lambda requires capturing variables from its scope.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any function declarations where a lambda expression is used as a default argument.
2. Check if the lambda attempts to use any parameters from the function declaration without explicit capture.
3. Modify the lambda to include an explicit capture of the necessary variables. Use the capture-by-value or capture-by-reference syntax explicitly.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the function parameter that needs to be captured in the lambda.
- Modify the lambda expression to include a capture clause:
  - If the variable should be captured by value, use `[=]` or specify the variable explicitly in the capture list.
  - If the variable should be captured by reference, use `[&]` or specify the variable with the `&` prefix in the capture list.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct;
void myFunction(MyStruct s = [] { return s; });
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct;
void myFunction(MyStruct s = [&s] { return s; });
```

Explanation:
The lambda expression in the default argument now explicitly captures the function parameter `s` by reference, complying with lambda capture rules and potentially preventing crashes related to implicit captures.
