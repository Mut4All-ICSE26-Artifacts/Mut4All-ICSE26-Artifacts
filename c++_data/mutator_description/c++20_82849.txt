Mutation Operator: Modify Template Concept

Target Code Construct: Template Concept Usage within a Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the code that uses a concept with a template declaration.
2. Locate the point in the function where the concept is used to constrain the template parameter.
3. Introduce a conditional construct (e.g., if or switch) that uses the template parameter constrained by the concept.
4. Ensure the conditional construct does not provide a concrete execution path for all possible values of the template parameter, leaving some conditions ambiguous.

Step-by-step Example:
- Given Original Code:
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  concept C = requires {
    [] {};
  };

  template <typename T>
  void b() {
    C<int>;
  }
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  1. Introduce a conditional statement inside the function `b`:
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  void b() {
    if constexpr (C<T>) {
      // Add some operation here that depends on T
    } else {
      // Leave this block empty, creating ambiguity
    }
  }
  ```

Explanation:
This mutation focuses on the template parameter constrained by a concept and introduces a conditional that does not account for all potential values of T. The lack of clear handling for all paths can cause the compiler to experience difficulty during constant expression evaluation, potentially leading to a crash or undefined behavior, especially under complex concept constraints.
