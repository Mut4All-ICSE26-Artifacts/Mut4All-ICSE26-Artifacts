Mutation Operator: Modify Constexpr Functions with Deleted Operators

Target: Constexpr function declarations, particularly operator overloads, within a class or struct.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct that has a member function, particularly an operator overload, declared with the `constexpr` keyword.
2. Alter the function to include deletion (`= delete`) after the declaration.
3. Ensure the function has a reference or pointer return type to increase the likelihood of triggering compiler edge cases.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct Sample {
    constexpr int operator+(const Sample &other) { return 0; }
};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct Sample {
    constexpr int operator+(const Sample &other) = delete;
};
```

Explanation:
1. Locate any `constexpr` operator overload within a struct or class.
2. Apply `= delete` to the operator, ensuring it is a return type that involves a reference or pointer.
3. This mutation works within the context of existing structures, altering behavior in a way that can expose issues in the handling of `constexpr` with deleted functions, which has been identified as problematic in some compiler implementations, specifically in the case of `clang` according to the provided bug report.
