Based on the provided bug report, the crash was triggered using a structured binding assignment in tandem with the `-fopenmp` flag. The report suggests that the C++ compiler bugs are more likely to be triggered by complex type manipulations, particularly those involving structured bindings and concurrent execution settings like OpenMP.

Mutation Operator:
1. Target Code Construct: Structured Binding with Custom Struct
2. Mutation Rule:
   - Identify any structured binding declarations in the code that unpack a custom struct.
   - Introduce an OpenMP parallel region within the function that utilizes the variables bound by the structured binding.
   - Ensure that the structured binding is declared outside the OpenMP parallel region to maintain scope.
   
   For example, given a structured binding declaration:
   ```
   struct CustomStruct {
       int a;
       double b;
   };

   CustomStruct cs = {1, 2.0};
   auto [x, y] = cs;

   void useBoundVariables() {
       // Original usage
       auto result = x + y;
   }
   ```

   Apply the mutation:
   ```
   void useBoundVariables() {
       // Introduce OpenMP parallel region
       #pragma omp parallel
       {
           // Use variables inside OpenMP context
           auto result = x + y;
       }
   }
   ```
   - Ensure that the OpenMP directives are correctly applied around the usage of the bound variables, and that the pragma directives are syntactically correct.
   
This mutation operator aims to test the compiler's handling of structured bindings when used in conjunction with OpenMP parallel regions, which can expose concurrency-related issues or handling inconsistencies in the compiler.
