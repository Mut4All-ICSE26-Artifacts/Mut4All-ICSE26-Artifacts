Mutation Operator: Modify Template Specialization

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets template classes and their specializations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class declaration with one or more template parameters.
2. Locate a specialization or instantiation of this template class in the code.
3. Introduce a modification in the specialization or instantiation by altering the type or number of template arguments while ensuring that it doesn't match a valid specialization or instantiation pattern in the existing code.

Example:

Original Code:
```cpp
template<class T>
struct MyStruct {
    T member;
};

MyStruct<int> instance;
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Identify the template class `MyStruct` with the parameter `T`.
2. Locate its instantiation `MyStruct<int> instance`.
3. Modify the instantiation by changing the template argument to a non-existent or inappropriate type, e.g., a function pointer or introduce an additional parameter.

Mutated Code:
```cpp
MyStruct<void(*)(int)> instance;  // Modified by changing int to a function pointer type
```

Note: This mutation operator intentionally creates a mismatch in template specialization to test the compiler's robustness in handling incorrect template instantiations, which can potentially lead to assertion failures or crashes during compilation.
