Mutation Operator: Modify Template Argument Usage

Target: Template declarations and usage within source code.

Mutation Rule: This mutation targets template declarations and usages where `std::variant` or similar constructs with multiple template arguments are used. The goal is to modify the count or type of template arguments to explore different error paths.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify template declarations or usages in the seed program. For example, locate lines where `std::variant`, `std::tuple`, or similar constructs are used.
2. In a template declaration, add an additional type to the list of template arguments. For instance, if the original code is `std::variant<Type1, Type2, Type3>`, change it to `std::variant<Type1, Type2, Type3, Type4>`.
3. Ensure that the new type (e.g., `Type4`) is a legitimate C++ type. If it doesn't exist in the seed program, add a simple and valid type declaration like `struct Type4 {};` at the beginning of the source code.
4. Recompile the program to observe any changes in behavior. This modification may affect template instantiation and cause compiler errors or crashes if unhandled cases exist.

Example Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
using MyVariant = std::variant<int, double, std::string>;
```

Example After Mutation:
```cpp
struct NewType {};

template <typename T>
using MyVariant = std::variant<int, double, std::string, NewType>;
```

Rationale: Modifying the template arguments of constructs like `std::variant` can stress-test the compiler's template handling logic, particularly in managing type expansions and deductions, which are common areas where bugs can manifest.
