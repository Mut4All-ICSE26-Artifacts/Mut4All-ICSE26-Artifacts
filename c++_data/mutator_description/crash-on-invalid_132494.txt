Mutation Operator: Template Specialization with Incomplete Type

Target Code Construct: Class Template Specialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template specialization in the seed program that uses an incomplete or undefined type as a template argument.
2. Ensure the program includes a declaration of an enum or a struct that is not defined, similar to `enum struct EnumClass;`.
3. Implement a static assertion or a type trait that attempts to instantiate a template with this incomplete type.
4. Specifically utilize a type trait like `is_class` that would require the type to be complete for its evaluation.

Example of Pseudo-Code:
1. Declare an incomplete type:
   ```
   enum struct UndefinedEnum;
   ```

2. Define a template specialization using the incomplete type:
   ```
   template <class T>
   struct CheckType : decltype(test<T>(0)) {};
   ```

3. Use a static assertion with the template specialization:
   ```
   static_assert(CheckType<UndefinedEnum>::value, "Type check failed.");
   ```

Explanation:
This operator targets scenarios where a class template specialization is instantiated with an incomplete type, leading to potential crashes in the compiler's type-checking mechanism. The mutation leverages incomplete type declarations to test how the compiler handles cases where it must resolve types that lack full definitions, which can trigger assertion failures or crashes in the compiler's internal logic.
