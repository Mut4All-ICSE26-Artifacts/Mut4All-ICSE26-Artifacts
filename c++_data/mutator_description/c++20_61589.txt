Mutation Operator: Modify Concept Requirements with Template Specialization

Target: Concept requirements within template specializations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a concept that has specific requirements, such as `constraint` in the provided bug example.
2. Introduce a specialized version of a template that interacts with this concept requirement, altering the evaluation path.
3. For example, modify a template specialization that involves a concept by introducing a new template that adds an additional condition or modifies a type expectation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a concept definition within your code. For instance, `concept constraint` is used in the example.
- Identify a template specialization that uses this concept. In the example, `callbale_with_nth_parameter_being_expand` is a candidate.
- Introduce a new specialization or alter an existing one by adding a condition that changes the type used or expected, potentially causing an error in concept evaluation.

Example:
Suppose you have the following concept and template specialization:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept example_concept = requires {
    // original condition
    typename T::identifier;
};

template<typename T, typename S>
struct example_specialization {};

template<typename T>
struct example_specialization<T, std::enable_if_t<example_concept<T>>> {
    // original behavior
};
```

Mutation:
- Introduce a new specialization that leverages `example_concept` but changes the type condition:

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct example_specialization<T, std::enable_if_t<!example_concept<T>>> {
    // mutated behavior
    // This specialization will be instantiated when T does not satisfy example_concept
};
```

This mutation operator ensures that the concept evaluation path is altered, potentially revealing bugs in how concepts are handled in template specializations.
