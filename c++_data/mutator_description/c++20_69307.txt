Mutation Operator: Modify Requires Clause in Lambda

Target: This mutation operator targets lambda expressions in the source code, specifically those that have a `requires` clause.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify lambda expressions with a `requires` clause.
2. For each of these lambda expressions, modify the `requires` clause by adding an additional requirement that references an existing type or variable in the program.
3. To ensure the modification does not introduce an undeclared reference, you must first identify variables or types that are in scope for the lambda expression.
4. If no suitable in-scope entities exist, introduce a simple dummy constexpr variable or type declaration before the lambda expression and use that in the mutation.

Example:
Original:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto a) requires requires { a + a; } {
    return a + a;
};
```

Mutated:
1. If `b` is a variable in scope:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto a) requires requires { a + a; b; } {
    return a + a;
};
```

2. If no suitable in-scope variable exists:
```cpp
constexpr int dummyVar = 0;
auto lambda = [](auto a) requires requires { a + a; dummyVar; } {
    return a + a;
};
```

This mutation operator leverages the subtlety of template and constraint satisfaction logic in C++20, which is a complex area that can often lead to unexpected compiler behavior, especially in terms of edge cases in constraint satisfaction logic.
