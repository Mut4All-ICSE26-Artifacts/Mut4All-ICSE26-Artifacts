Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Function Declarations with Incorrect Access Specifiers

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify function declarations inside a class definition.
2. For each function, check if it explicitly specifies an unnecessary or duplicate access specifier, such as 'private', 'public', or 'protected'.
3. Introduce an incorrect access specifier to a function declaration by duplicating one that already exists, or by inserting an irrelevant one.

Example:
- Original Code:
  ```
  class MyClass {
  public:
      void myFunction();
  };
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```
  class MyClass {
  public public:
      void myFunction();
  };
  ```
  OR
  ```
  class MyClass {
  private:
      void myFunction();
  public:
  };
  ```

This mutation operator targets class declarations and modifies function declarations to include incorrect or redundant access specifiers. By creating conflicts or duplications in access specifiers, it is likely to trigger errors related to invalid class structure or function declaration processing.
