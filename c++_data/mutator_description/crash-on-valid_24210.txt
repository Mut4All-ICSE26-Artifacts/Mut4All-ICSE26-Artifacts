Mutation Operator:
Target: Array Initialization with std::array

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify declarations of `std::array` in the codebase, with particular focus on arrays that have empty initializations.
2. Locate the array declaration line. Example: `std::array<std::unordered_map<int, int>, 5> v = {};`.
3. Modify the initializer list to contain at least one element, ensuring that the element type matches the `std::array` template parameter.
4. If necessary, declare a new variable to match the element type of the `std::array`, for example, `std::unordered_map<int, int> map_instance;`.
5. Replace the empty initialization with an initializer list that includes the newly declared element or an existing compatible element. Example transformation: change `std::array<std::unordered_map<int, int>, 5> v = {};` to `std::array<std::unordered_map<int, int>, 5> v = {map_instance};`.

By performing this mutation, the array will have at least one initialized element, which may help identify issues related to default initialization or structural setup within the compiler's handling of such code.
