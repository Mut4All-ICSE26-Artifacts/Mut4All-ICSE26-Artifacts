Mutation Operator: Struct Member Lookup Error

Target: This mutation operator targets the struct member lookup mechanism within class or struct definitions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a valid class or struct definition in the seed program.
2. Within this class or struct, locate a member function or member variable declaration.
3. Introduce an additional member variable or function with the same name as an existing one, but with an incompatible type or signature. This forces the compiler to handle ambiguous member names.

Example:
Consider the following seed program snippet:

```cpp
struct ExampleStruct {
    int memberFunction(int x) { return x; }
};
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Identify the existing member function `memberFunction`.
2. Introduce a new member with the same name, but change its signature to cause ambiguity:

```cpp
struct ExampleStruct {
    int memberFunction(int x) { return x; }
    double memberFunction(double y) { return y; } // New overloaded member with incompatible type
};
```

Explanation:
This mutation introduces ambiguity by overloading `memberFunction` with a different return type and parameter type. The mutation leverages the compiler's lookup mechanism, which may struggle to resolve such ambiguities, potentially triggering bugs related to member name resolution. This mutation is widely applicable to any class or struct with member functions and can expose flaws in the compiler's type resolution logic.
