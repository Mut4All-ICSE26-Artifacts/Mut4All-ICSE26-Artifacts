Mutation Operator:
Target: Constructor in Class or Struct Definition
Objective: Induce a compiler crash by introducing a missing or malformed constructor definition.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct definition in the seed program.
2. Check if the class or struct has a constructor defined. If it does not, proceed to step 3. If it does, continue with another class or struct.
3. Introduce a malformed constructor definition, ensuring that:
   - The constructor lacks a proper parameter list or body.
   - The constructor declaration is syntactically incorrect (e.g., missing parentheses or braces).
4. Ensure that the class or struct has an instance created in some part of the code to trigger the constructor call.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct MyStruct {
    int value;
};
```
Mutation:
```
struct MyStruct {
    int value;
    MyStruct { // Missing parentheses for constructor
        // Constructor body missing
    }
};
```

Explanation: By introducing a malformed constructor in the class or struct, we trigger mechanisms in the compiler related to special member functions, potentially leading to misbehavior or crashes similar to those described in the bug report. This mutation targets the part of the compiler dealing with constructor handling, which is known to have vulnerabilities in certain edge cases, especially when the code is syntactically incorrect.
