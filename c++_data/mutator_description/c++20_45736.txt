Mutation Operator: Alter Concept Requirement Evaluation

Target Construct: Concept definitions and usage in constrained templates or functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function with a concept requirement. For example, a function template or a constructor with a `requires` clause that uses a concept.
2. Modify the concept requirement by changing the function or predicate used to determine satisfaction. Specifically, introduce a condition that involves ambiguous or conflicting types.
3. The mutation applies to the concept requirement part of the template function or constructor.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate the function or constructor definition that includes a concept requirement, e.g., `template<typename U> requires matches<U> explicit constrained(U value) {}`.
- Change the requires clause to involve a condition that can lead to an ambiguous evaluation. For example, introduce a secondary check based on a different concept or predicate not directly related to the type `U`.
- If the current concept is `matches<U>`, replace it with a newly defined or altered concept that includes an additional logical condition. For example:
  - Define a new concept `ambiguous` with similar structure. 
  - Use an alternative predicate in the concept that might not be satisfied with the given type, such as `f(type<int>) && f(type<U>)`.

Example Pseudo-code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept ambiguous = (f(type<int>) && f(type<T>));

struct constrained {
    template<typename U> requires ambiguous<U>
    explicit constrained(U value) {
        // Constructor implementation
    }
};
```

This mutation rule introduces a secondary condition that may conflict with the expected type, increasing the likelihood of triggering logical errors or inconsistencies in the compiler's concept satisfaction evaluation process.
