Mutation Operator: Modify Enum Usage with Type Traits

Target Code Construct: Enum and Type Traits Application

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing enum declaration within the code, such as:
   ```cpp
   enum Day {
       sunday, monday, tuesday, wednesday,
       thursday, friday, saturday
   };
   ```

2. Introduce a misuse of a type trait, such as `std::is_integral`, on an enum value. Enclose the enum value within `std::integral_constant` to create a scenario that might confuse the type system.

3. Replace an enum value in the code with a misuse of the type trait:
   - Original: Use an enum normally, e.g., `Day today = sunday;`
   - Mutated: Use a type trait incorrectly, e.g., 
     ```cpp
     std::integral_constant<Day, sunday> today;
     ```

4. Ensure that the surrounding code attempts to use the enum value in a context where a plain enum is expected, potentially causing type mismatches or unexpected behavior.

Example Pseudo-code:
```cpp
#include <type_traits>

enum Fruit {
    apple, banana, cherry
};

int main() {
    // Original usage
    // Fruit favorite = apple;

    // Mutated usage with type trait misuse
    std::integral_constant<Fruit, apple> favorite;
}
```

This mutation operator aims to misuse the application of type traits with enums, which can lead to unexpected behavior or compiler crashes if the type trait is not designed to handle enum types properly. By applying this operator, we target potential weaknesses in how compilers handle type traits with non-integer types like enums.
