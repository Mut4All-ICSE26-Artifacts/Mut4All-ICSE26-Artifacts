Mutation Operator: Modify Requires Expressions Using Concepts and Inline Lambda

Target: This mutation operator targets the use of the `requires` expression within a concept definition, specifically involving inline lambda expressions that utilize `using` declarations and ADL (Argument Dependent Lookup).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a concept definition that uses a `requires` expression inside an inline lambda function.
2. Within this lambda, locate any `using` declarations that introduce names for lookup (e.g., using `std::begin` or `std::end`).
3. Alter the `requires` expression to check a different concept or constraint that impacts the lookup of functions or iterators, such as modifying the iterator type or changing the order of operations.
4. Ensure that the mutation interacts with types or functions that are already declared in the context (e.g., if modifying iterators, stay within the same iterator category).

Example Pseudo-Code:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept HasBeginEnd = []{
    using std::begin;
    using std::end;

    return requires(T& t)
    {
        { begin(t) } -> std::input_iterator;
        { end(t) } -> std::input_iterator;
    };
}();
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept HasBeginEnd = []{
    using std::begin;
    using std::end;

    return requires(T& t)
    {
        { end(t) } -> std::input_iterator;  // Swapped order of begin and end
        { begin(t) } -> std::input_iterator;
    };
}();
```

This mutation operator leverages changes in the sequence or type of operations within the `requires` expression, encouraging the exploration of potential ambiguities or crashes arising from ADL and usage declarations in conjunction with iterator concepts.
