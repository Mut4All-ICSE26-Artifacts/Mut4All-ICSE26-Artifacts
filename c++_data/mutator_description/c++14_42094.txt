Analyzing the bug report, it seems that the issue is triggered by the combination of variadic templates, lambda expressions defined inside function templates, and the use of `decltype(parameter)` as a return type. This specific combination appears to cause assertion failures and segmentation faults in the Clang compiler, likely due to how templates and scope are managed internally.

Mutation Operator:
1. **Target:** Lambda expressions inside function templates
2. **Mutation Rule:** 
   - **Step 1:** Identify a lambda expression defined inside a function template.
   - **Step 2:** Change the lambda's return type to `decltype(parameter)`, where `parameter` is a local variable or a parameter passed to the function template enclosing the lambda.
   - **Step 3:** Ensure that the `parameter` used in `decltype` is not directly captured by the lambda.

Example (Pseudo-code):
```cpp
template<typename T>
auto exampleFunction(T param) {
    // Original lambda
    auto lambda = [](auto x) { return x; };
    
    // Mutated lambda
    auto mutatedLambda = [](auto x) -> decltype(param) { return param; };
}
```

This mutation deliberately creates a situation where the lambda's return type depends on a template parameter not directly captured, potentially leading to scope and template deduction issues, which are known to cause instability in some compilers. This approach ensures that the mutation is both universal and has broad coverage across similar constructs.
