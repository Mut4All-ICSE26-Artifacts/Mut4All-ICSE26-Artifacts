Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Expression to Use Recursive Trailing Return Type

Target Code Construct: Lambda Expressions with Trailing Return Types

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression in the code that uses a trailing return type.
2. Modify the lambda to use a recursive trailing return type. This involves:
   - Ensuring that the lambda calls itself in its return statement.
   - The trailing return type should be explicitly declared to match the recursive call pattern.

Example Mutation:
Original Lambda:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](int x) -> int {
    return x + 1;
};
```
Mutated Lambda:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](int x) -> decltype(lambda(x + 1)) {
    return x > 0 ? lambda(x - 1) : x + 1;
};
```

Explanation:
- We target lambda expressions with trailing return types because they are known to cause complex behavior in the context of recursive calls and type deduction, as inferred from the bug report.
- The mutation introduces recursion and a trailing return type that relies on the lambda itself, potentially leading to intricate interactions between type deduction and recursion, which are prone to trigger compiler issues.
- This pattern maintains universality and high coverage, as it can be applied to any lambda function with integer parameters and return types, regardless of its original logic.
