Based on the provided bug report, it appears that the C++ compiler is more likely to crash when dealing with lambda expressions that capture 'this', especially within certain complex or nested contexts. To design a mutation operator that increases the likelihood of compiler bugs, we should focus on modifying lambda expressions and their captures, particularly in situations involving struct members or nested lambdas.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Lambda expressions capturing 'this' within a struct or class member function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression within a struct or class that captures 'this'.
2. Modify the capture of 'this' by introducing an additional capture by value of another member variable in the same struct or class.
3. Ensure that the lambda still performs a legitimate operation, such as returning a struct or calling a member function.

Example:
Original Code:
struct Example {
  int x;
  std::function<void()> func = [this]() { /* some operations */ };
};

Mutation:
1. Locate the lambda capturing 'this' inside the struct Example.
2. Modify the lambda to additionally capture 'x' by value.
3. Ensure that 'x' is used within the lambda body.

Mutated Code:
struct Example {
  int x;
  std::function<void()> func = [this, x]() { /* some operations involving x */ };
}; 

This mutation increases the complexity of the lambda captures, which can potentially trigger bugs similar to the one reported, especially if the compiler has issues managing captures involving 'this' and other member variables.
