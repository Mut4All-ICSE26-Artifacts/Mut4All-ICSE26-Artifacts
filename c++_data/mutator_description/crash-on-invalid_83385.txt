Mutation Operator: Malformed Attribute on Function Declaration

Target Construct:
This mutation operator targets function declarations in C++ code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function declaration in the seed program. Ensure the function has a return type and parameter list, and it is not a function definition (i.e., it does not have a body).
2. Apply a malformed attribute before the function declaration, which typically uses the syntax `[[attribute_name]]`. Intentionally create a malformed attribute by omitting the attribute name or by inserting invalid characters or syntax within the brackets.
3. Ensure the malformed attribute is syntactically incorrect.

Example of Mutation:
Given the seed program with a function declaration:

```
void exampleFunction(int a, double b);
```

Apply the malformed attribute:

```
[[]] void exampleFunction(int a, double b);
```

or

```
[[malformed@]] void exampleFunction(int a, double b);
```

Rationale:
By introducing a malformed attribute on a function declaration, it specifically targets the handling of attributes by the compiler's parsing and semantic analysis components. This mutation is likely to trigger parsing and semantic issues similar to those observed in the provided bug report, potentially leading to compiler crashes.
