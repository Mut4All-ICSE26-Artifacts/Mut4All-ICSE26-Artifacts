Based on the given bug report, it indicates that C++ constructs being used inside C code can trigger compiler crashes. This suggests that the parser may not be handling certain C++ specific tokens correctly when it expects C syntax, particularly those related to scope resolution and other C++-specific features.

Mutation Operator:

Target Code Construct: Function declarations and definitions in C code.

Mutation Rule:
- Locate a function declaration or definition within a C file.
- Add a C++ qualifier or token that is not valid in standard C, such as `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, or use of `::` for scope resolution, within the function's definition.
- Specifically, modify a parameter type within a function declaration by using a C++-specific cast operation (e.g., `const_cast<int*>` or `dynamic_cast<Base*>`).

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a function declaration or definition in the C code. For example:
   ```
   void exampleFunction(int x);
   ```

2. Modify the type of the parameter by introducing a C++-specific element that is invalid in C, such as a cast operation:
   ```
   void exampleFunction(const_cast<int*>(x));
   ```

3. Ensure the modified C file is saved and attempt to compile it using the C compiler to observe whether the mutation triggers an error or crash.

By introducing C++-specific constructs into C code, the mutation operator aims to exploit parsing weaknesses or incorrect assumptions in the compiler's handling of language-specific syntax, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting such vulnerabilities.
