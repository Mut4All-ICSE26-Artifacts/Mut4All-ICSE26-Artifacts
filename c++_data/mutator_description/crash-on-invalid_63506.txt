Mutation Operator: Undefined Type Pointer Mutation

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets pointers to undefined struct types within the code.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any pointer declaration to an undefined struct type (e.g., `struct Undefined;` followed by `Undefined* ptr;`).
2. Convert the pointer type declaration to a pointer to a fully defined struct type. If the struct is not defined, create a minimal definition.
3. Ensure that the converted pointer is initialized or utilized in the same manner as the original.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code Snippet:
```cpp
struct Undefined;

Undefined* value = nullptr;
```

Mutation Process:
1. Locate the undefined type `struct Undefined;`.
2. Define the struct minimally:
   ```cpp
   struct Undefined {
       int dummy;
   };
   ```
3. Ensure `value` remains a pointer to `Undefined` and is initialized as before:
   ```cpp
   Undefined* value = nullptr;
   ```

Rationale:
This mutation operator addresses scenarios where a pointer to an undefined type can cause frontend compiler crashes. By ensuring the struct is defined, even minimally, it allows the compiler to process the type correctly, reducing the risk of crashing due to invalid operations on incomplete types. This operator ensures broader applicability across various codebases by focusing on undefined type pointers, a common source of compiler errors.
