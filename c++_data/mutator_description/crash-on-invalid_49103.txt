Mutation Operator:
Target: Template Instantiation within Structs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition that includes a template instantiation.
2. Replace the template instantiation with an invocation of a built-in compiler intrinsic or pseudo-function that requires specific argument types, such as `__make_integer_seq`, but provide it with incorrect or excessive number of arguments.
3. Ensure that the template type or argument deviates from what is typically required or documented, but still maintains syntactic correctness.

Example:
Original Code Segment:
```
template <typename T> struct TemplateStruct;
struct MyStruct {
    TemplateStruct<int> member;
};
```

Mutated Code Segment:
```
template <typename T> struct TemplateStruct;
struct MyStruct {
    __make_integer_seq<TemplateStruct, int, 1, 2> member;
};
```

Explanation:
- The mutation operator targets templates within structs, ensuring the modified code involves instantiating a template with an inappropriate call to a compiler intrinsic.
- This leverages incorrect usage of arguments for a system-specific function, potentially exploiting edge cases in the compiler's type checking and template processing, leading to crashes.
