Mutation Operator: Modify Noexcept Specifier in Function Declaration

Target: Function Declarations with Noexcept Specifiers

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function declaration that includes a `noexcept` specifier with an expression, such as `noexcept(Expression)`. This expression is often used to indicate whether a function is allowed to throw exceptions and must evaluate to a constant expression.
   
2. Replace the current `noexcept` expression with one that cannot be evaluated as a constant expression at compile time. This can involve using expressions that involve non-constexpr functions, operations on variables that are not constant, or expressions dependent on runtime values.

3. Example original code:
   ```
   bool condition = true;
   void exampleFunction() noexcept(condition) {
       // Function implementation
   }
   ```

4. Mutated code:
   ```
   bool condition = true;
   void exampleFunction() noexcept(condition && std::declval<int>()) {
       // Function implementation
   }
   ```

5. Ensure the `std::declval<int>()` introduces a non-constexpr operation in the `noexcept` expression. The declval is a common way to provoke compile-time evaluation issues.

This mutation operator is likely to expose issues related to the evaluation of `noexcept` expressions, potentially leading to compilation errors or crashes in the compiler front-end if it mishandles complex `noexcept` specifiers.
