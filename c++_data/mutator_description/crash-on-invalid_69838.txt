Mutation Operator: Misuse of Explicit Object Parameter in Constructor

Target Code Construct: Constructor of a class or struct.

Mutation Rule: Modify the constructor of a class or struct to improperly include an explicit object parameter using `this` with the `auto` keyword. This targets cases where explicit object parameters are incorrectly used, which can lead to compiler crashes due to improper context handling.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a class or struct in the seed program that has a constructor. If none exists, introduce a simple class or struct definition.
2. Modify the constructor to include an explicit object parameter incorrectly. Use the `this` keyword with the `auto` specifier as the parameter.
3. Ensure that this explicit object parameter is placed at the beginning of the constructor parameter list.

Example in Pseudo-code form:
Original code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {}
};
```

Mutated code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass(this auto &self) {}
};
```

Note: The mutation intends to introduce a construct that should be invalid according to the C++ standard, potentially triggering compiler bugs related to parsing and context deduction where such constructs are not handled gracefully. This approach emphasizes leveraging existing structures in the seed program while ensuring the mutation is both easily applicable and likely to expose compiler vulnerabilities across various contexts.
