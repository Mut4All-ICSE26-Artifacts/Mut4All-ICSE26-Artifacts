Mutation Operator: Template Specialization with Invalid Base

Target Code Construct: Template struct inheritance in combination with function templates.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a template struct that inherits from another template struct, like `struct C: public A<int>::B<D>`.
2. Alter the base struct's template specialization to an invalid or non-existent type.
3. Specifically, change the template parameter of the base struct to an undefined type or mismatch it with an incompatible type.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the struct inheritance that uses template parameters: `struct C: public A<int>::B<D>`.
- Modify it to use a type that is not defined in the scope of program, for example: `struct C: public A<int>::B<UndefinedType>` or use a primitive type instead of a class or struct where a class or struct is expected, such as `struct C: public A<int>::B<int>`.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
template <class T>
struct A {
  template <class V> struct B {
    int MEM;
  };
};

struct D {};
struct C: public A<int>::B<D> {};
```

Mutated:
```
template <class T>
struct A {
  template <class V> struct B {
    int MEM;
  };
};

struct C: public A<int>::B<UndefinedType> {}; // UndefinedType is not declared anywhere
```

This mutation operator exploits the compiler's inability to handle undefined or mismatched template specializations correctly, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior during template instantiation or name mangling processes.
