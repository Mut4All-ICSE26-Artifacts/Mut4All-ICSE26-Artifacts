Mutation Operator: Invalid Inline Assembly in Function Definition

Target Code Construct: Function definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program. If no other functions are present, use the `main` function.
2. Insert an inline assembly block using the `asm` keyword directly within the function body. Ensure the assembly code is syntactically incorrect or incomplete.
3. The incorrect inline assembly should not reference any valid registers or operations, which may cause the compiler to crash during LLVM IR generation.

Example:
Original Code:
```
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    return a;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    asm("mov %0, %1" :: "r"(a)); // deliberately incorrect or incomplete asm statement
    return a;
}
```

Instructions:
- Ensure that the inline assembly block is placed within the scope of the identified function.
- The assembly code should purposely miss required components or use invalid tokens to trigger a potential bug in the compiler.
- Avoid using valid or complete inline assembly to maintain invalidity, which increases the likelihood of compiler crashes.
