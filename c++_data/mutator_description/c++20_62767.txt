Mutation Operator: Template Argument Deduction

Target Construct: Template function instantiation
Applicable Location: In function template calls

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template that has a non-type template parameter (e.g., a template that expects a value such as an integer or a string literal).
2. Change the non-type template argument to a different valid value type that the template can accept but is atypical or less commonly used in conjunction with current template constraints. For example, change a string literal to an integer literal if both are acceptable.
3. If the template expects an array type as part of the deduction, replace it with a similarly formed array type but with a different size or type, ensuring it still passes type checks.

Example:
Original Seed Program:
```cpp
template<int N> struct ArrayWrapper {};
template <ArrayWrapper aw> void process() {}

int main() {
  process<ArrayWrapper<5>>();
}
```

Mutated Version:
1. Change the integer literal inside `ArrayWrapper` to a different integer (ensure it remains valid and relevant to the template's purpose). This is done to verify the robustness of the template's deduction mechanism under different values.
```cpp
int main() {
  process<ArrayWrapper<10>>();
}
```
This operator encourages testing how changes in non-type template arguments, particularly those related to size or integral constants, can affect template argument deduction and instantiation, potentially triggering under-tested paths in compiler logic.
