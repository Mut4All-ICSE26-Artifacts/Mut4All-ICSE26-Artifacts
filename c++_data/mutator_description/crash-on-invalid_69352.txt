Mutation Operator: Overflowing Enum Initializer

Target: Enum declaration with integer initializers

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum declaration in the source code.
2. Select an enum constant within this enum that is initialized with a simple integer literal or binary arithmetic operation involving integers.
3. Replace the initializer with a very large integer literal that does not fit within typical integer constraints - ensuring that it exceeds the width of a standard data type, such as unsigned long long.
4. Use a numeric suffix or encoding that is likely to be unsupported or cause the type to overflow, such as a non-standard suffix for a bit integer, e.g., a number followed by a suffix like "wb".

Example Before Mutation:
```
enum Color { RED = 1, GREEN = 2, BLUE = 3 };
```

Example After Mutation:
```
enum Color { RED = 1, GREEN = 2, BLUE = 12345678901234567890wb };
```

This mutation exploits the handling of large integer literals in enum initializers, potentially triggering bugs related to integer overflow or unsupported suffixes in the compiler's parser or semantic analysis phases.
