Mutation Operator:

Target: Class template with default member initializers containing lambda expressions.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a class template with default member initializers in the seed program.
2. Locate a default member initializer that contains a lambda expression.
3. Modify the lambda expression by introducing a capture of a local variable that is not yet declared within the scope of the lambda. This will create an incomplete capture scenario.
4. Ensure that the lambda is still syntactically correct by declaring the captured variable after the lambda definition within the same function scope.
5. Recompile and test if the mutation affects the compiler behavior, particularly focusing on its parsing and code generation stages.

Example (Pseudo-code):
Original:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Container {
    T data = [](){ return T(); }();
};
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Container {
    T data = [captured_var](){ return T(); }(); // Step 3: Introduce a capture
    int captured_var = 42; // Step 4: Declare the captured variable after the lambda
};
```

This mutation operator targets the handling of lambda expressions within default member initializers in class templates, specifically creating conditions that may challenge the compiler's ability to properly resolve captures and dependencies. By manipulating the capture list and the order of declarations, this operator could trigger potential issues in abstract syntax tree (AST) construction and code generation processes.
