Mutation Operator: Modify Array Initialization in Constructor

Target: Constructor initialization of array types in structures

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constructor within a struct or class where an array member is being initialized.
2. Change the manner in which the array is initialized to trigger a potential compiler issue.
3. Specifically, replace the dynamic memory allocation with a static array initialization that mismatches the declared size.

Steps:
- Locate the array member initialization in the constructor. For example, in `struct X { int (&data)[3]; X() : data(*new int[1][3]) { } };`.
- Replace the dynamic array initialization with a static initializer list that does not match the declared array size:
  - If the original constructor is `X() : data(*new int[1][3])`, replace it with `X() : data({0, 1})`.
- Ensure that the static initializer list has a different number of elements than the declared array size.

Example Before Mutation:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int (&arr)[3];
    MyStruct() : arr(*new int[1][3]) { }
};
```

Example After Mutation:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int (&arr)[3];
    MyStruct() : arr({1, 2}) { }
};
```

Rationale:
This mutation targets the discrepancy between the declared array size and the initializer list count. By mismatching these, the compiler is forced to deal with incompatible initialization, which can reveal issues in handling array initializations, particularly when dealing with reference to arrays.
