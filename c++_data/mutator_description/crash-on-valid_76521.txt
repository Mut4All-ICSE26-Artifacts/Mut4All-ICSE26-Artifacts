Mutation Operator: Attribute Mutation in Lambda Expressions

Target Code Construct: Lambda expressions with attributes

Application: This mutation operator is applied to lambda expressions that are decorated with attributes. The operator modifies the attributes of the lambda expression to test how the compiler handles changes in attribute specifications.

Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a lambda expression in the program that contains one or more attributes.
Step 2: Select the attribute(s) within the lambda expression.
Step 3: Modify the attribute by either:
   a. Replacing the existing attribute with another valid attribute.
   b. Removing the attribute entirely to check if the lambda is still valid without it.
   c. Adding another valid attribute alongside the existing one.
Step 4: Ensure that the replacement or addition is meaningful within the context of the seed program and valid by C++ standards.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
auto l = []() __attribute__((pcs("aapcs-vfp"))) {};
```

Mutated Code (Replacement):
```cpp
auto l = []() __attribute__((used)) {};
```

Mutated Code (Removal):
```cpp
auto l = []() {};
```

Mutated Code (Addition):
```cpp
auto l = []() __attribute__((pcs("aapcs-vfp"), aligned(16))) {};
```

This operator aims to test the compiler's robustness in handling lambda expressions with various attribute configurations.
