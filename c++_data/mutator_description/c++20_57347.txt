Mutation Operator: Enum Class Misuse

Target Construct: Enum

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a valid `enum class` declaration in the seed program. For instance, you may find:
   ```
   enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };
   ```
2. Insert a `using` declaration with an incomplete or incorrect specification of the enum, similar to the bug example.

3. Modify the code by introducing a `using enum` statement without an identifier to reference, simulating misuse. For example:
   ```
   void misusedFunction() {
       using enum; // Incorrect usage, missing enum class identifier
   }
   ```

This mutation targets the misuse of the `enum class` construct by simulating a misstatement in the `using` declaration, which is likely to trigger frontend crashes or errors similar to the reported bug. It uses already existing enums in the seed program and modifies their usage contextually to reflect a potential misuse.
