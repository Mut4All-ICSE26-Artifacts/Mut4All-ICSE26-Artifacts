The bug report indicates a failure in the C++ compiler related to access checks within template instantiation, particularly involving meta-type arrays and related template mechanisms.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Template Instantiation and Access Modifiers
Description: This mutation operator targets the template definition and instantiation process, specifically focusing on access specifiers within member functions or types in template classes. It modifies access specifiers to potentially trigger access-related errors during template instantiation.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template or a template function in the code.
2. Locate a member function or a data member within the template.
3. Change the access specifier of this member to a more restrictive one (e.g., public to protected).
4. Ensure the modified access specifier contradicts usage instances, such as accessing the member from a derived class or using it in a way that requires broader access.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Example {
public:
    void func(T value) {
        // Implementation
    }
};
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class Example {
protected:  // Changed from public to protected
    void func(T value) {
        // Implementation
    }
};
```
This mutation operator exploits the access control checks performed during template instantiation, which are more likely to lead to assertion failures or crash scenarios as depicted in the issue reported.
