Mutation Operator: Recursive Initialization in Constructors

Target Code Construct: Constructor within a class or struct

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct with a constructor. Ensure that the constructor does not currently include any form of self-referencing initialization.
2. Modify the constructor to include a self-referencing operation. Introduce a statement in the constructor that references an instance of the same class type within a function call or assignment similar to the initialization list.
3. Ensure the constructor is defined with an inline initialization that recursively utilizes a function that takes an instance of the same class or struct.
4. Example:
   - Original:
     ```
     struct B {
         B() { }
     };
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```
     struct B;

     int g(const B&) { return 0; }

     struct B {
         int y = g(B());
         B() { }
     };
     ```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets recursive initialization in constructors, where class instances are used in their own initialization. This type of modification is likely to trigger compiler bugs related to recursive calls or initialization sequences, as evidenced in the provided bug report. By applying this mutation, the constructor implicitly invokes recursive behavior that the compiler might mishandle, leading to crashes or segmentation faults.
