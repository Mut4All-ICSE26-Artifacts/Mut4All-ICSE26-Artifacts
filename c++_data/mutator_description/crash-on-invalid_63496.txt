Mutation Operator: Uninitialized Member Access in Class Constructor

Target Code Construct: Class member initialization within the constructor.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a class with a constructor and member variables.
2. Within the constructor, attempt to initialize or access a member variable that has not been declared.
3. If the class has an existing member variable, comment it out to simulate an undeclared member access.
4. Ensure the constructor still attempts to initialize the commented-out member variable, leading to an invalid access.

Example Scenario:
Consider a class definition with a constructor:

class ExampleClass {
    // int member; // Step 1: Comment out the declaration of the member variable.
    
public:
    ExampleClass(int x) : member(x) {} // Step 2: Attempt to initialize 'member' in the constructor.
};

void func() {
    ExampleClass obj(10); // Step 3: Instantiate the class, triggering the constructor.
}

Explanation:
In this mutation, the constructor tries to initialize a member variable that is not declared, mimicking the bug where undeclared members cause a crash. By following these steps, you can create a similar scenario where the compiler's handling of undeclared members during initialization is tested. This mutation is expected to cover a broad range of cases where member variables are accessed before declaration within constructors, potentially leading to similar crashes across different C++ compilers or versions.
