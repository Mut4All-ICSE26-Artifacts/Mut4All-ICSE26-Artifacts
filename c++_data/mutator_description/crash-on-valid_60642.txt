Mutation Operator:
Target: Template Concepts and Static Assertions
Applicable To: Code that defines and uses template concepts with static assertions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template concept definition. For example:
   ```
   template<auto Q> concept C = requires { Q.template operator()<int>(); };
   ```

2. Locate a static assertion that checks an instance of this concept. For example:
   ```
   static_assert(C<[]<D>{}>);
   ```

3. Modify the static assertion by introducing an additional layer of template instantiation using an inline constexpr variable, where this variable is a lambda expression. For instance:
   - Step 1: Introduce an inline constexpr variable:
     ```
     inline constexpr auto Q = []<D>{};
     ```

   - Step 2: Alter the static assertion to use this variable:
     ```
     static_assert(C<Q>);
     ```

4. Ensure the mutation still utilizes the concept in a nested manner within a different concept, to potentially trigger additional evaluation complexity:
   - Define another concept that nests the previous concept:
     ```
     template<class> concept E = C<Q>;
     ```

   - Use this new concept in another static assertion:
     ```
     static_assert(E<int>);
     ```

Example in Pseudo-Code:
- Original:
  ```
  template<auto Q> concept C = requires { Q.template operator()<int>(); };
  template<class> concept D = true;
  static_assert(C<[]<D>{}>);
  ```

- Mutated:
  ```
  template<auto Q> concept C = requires { Q.template operator()<int>(); };
  template<class> concept D = true;
  inline constexpr auto Q = []<D>{};
  template<class> concept E = C<Q>;
  static_assert(E<int>);
  ```

This mutation targets the complex interplay between template instantiations, lambda expressions, and concept evaluations, which has been observed to trigger ICE (Internal Compiler Error) in cases of concept satisfaction checks.
