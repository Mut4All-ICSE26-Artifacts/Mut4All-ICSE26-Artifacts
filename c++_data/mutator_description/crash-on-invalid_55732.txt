Mutation Operator:
- Target: Nested reference types
- Mutation Rule:
  1. Identify a variable declaration in the seed program where a simple type is used, such as `int`, `double`, or a user-defined type like `MyStruct`.
  2. Wrap the type in multiple layers of reference and const qualifiers in this pattern: `const Type&`, `const const Type&`, `const const const Type&`, and so on, to create excessive nesting.
  3. For example, if the original declaration is `int x;`, transform it to `const const const int& x;`.
  4. Continue nesting until reaching an impractical deep level that is unlikely in typical code, e.g., 20 or more levels.

This operator encourages the declaration of deeply nested reference types, which can help trigger parser errors or segmentation faults due to excessive and improper nesting that the compiler might not handle gracefully.
