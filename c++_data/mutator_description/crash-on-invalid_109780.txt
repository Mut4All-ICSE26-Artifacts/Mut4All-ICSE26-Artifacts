Mutation Operator:

Target Construct: Concept Declarations
Applicable Location: Within a C++ concept declaration using the `requires` keyword.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a concept declaration that uses the `requires` keyword, such as `concept ConceptName = requires(T a) { ... };`.
2. Introduce an additional `requires` keyword inside the `requires` expression block, creating a nested structure that is syntactically incorrect.
3. Ensure that the nested `requires` block attempts to introduce new variables or expressions that reference existing types or variables in the outer block.

Example Mutation:
Original:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept Addable = requires(T a, T b) {
    a + b;
};
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept Addable = requires(T a, T b) {
    requires (a + b) {
        a - b;
    };
};
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, we insert a `requires` keyword inside the existing `requires` block, creating a nested requirement that is not valid. This mutation exploits the processing of nested constraints, which can lead to parsing issues or crashes due to incorrect handling of concept syntax. By referencing existing variables `a` and `b`, we ensure that the mutation can be applied generically to any similar concept declaration.
