Mutation Operator: Modify Template Constraints

Target: Template specializations with constrained requirements.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template specialization that utilizes a constraint (concept) in its declaration. 
2. Alter the constraint expression to introduce a different logical condition that may lead to edge-case evaluation.
3. Specifically, modify the `sizeof` constraint expression. Replace it with an arithmetic operation involving `sizeof` to introduce potential ambiguities in the constraint evaluation.

Example:
Original code:
```cpp
template <class T>
  requires C<T>
struct A<T> {};
```

Mutation:
```cpp
template <class T>
  requires (sizeof(T) + 2 > 6) // Modified constraint
struct A<T> {};
```

This mutation introduces potential edge cases by altering the constraint's logical arithmetic operation, increasing the chance of triggering bugs related to constraint evaluation or template instantiation in the C++ compiler.
