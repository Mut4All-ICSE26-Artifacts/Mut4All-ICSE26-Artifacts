Mutation Operator: Template Conversion Operator in Member Function

Target Code Construct: Template Class with Conversion Operator in Member Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a template class in the seed program that defines a conversion operator template and a member function.
2. Within the member function of the template class, insert a call to the conversion operator template, ensuring the target type is explicitly specified. This should mimic the form `operator TargetType();`.
3. Ensure that the conversion operator call is placed as an isolated expression, preferably in a comma expression or as part of an arithmetic operation with a literal value, to simulate a potentially problematic usage.
4. Verify that the conversion operator template is not dependent on the template parameter of the class to trigger potential issues with type deduction.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template <typename U> struct Example {
   template <typename T> operator T();
   void process();
};

template <typename U>
void Example<U>::process() {
   // Original logic here
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
template <typename U> struct Example {
   template <typename T> operator T();
   void process();
};

template <typename U>
void Example<U>::process() {
   0, operator float(); // This triggers the mutation condition
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation involves placing a non-dependent call to a conversion function template directly within a member function of a template class. The potential bug arises from the compiler's handling of template type deduction and instantiation in such contexts, which may lead to assertion failures or crashes. The target type (e.g., `int`, `float`) should be explicitly specified in the mutation to ensure the conversion operator is invoked correctly. This mutation strategy harnesses the peculiarities of template instantiation and overload resolution in C++ compilers, providing a broad coverage for testing and identifying related bugs.
