Mutation Operator: Template Class Incorrect Base Class

Target: This mutation operator targets template class specializations and their base class specifications.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class specialization that inherits from another template class.
2. Replace the base class of the specialization with a non-template or an invalid/non-existent class type.
3. Ensure that the base class type specified in the mutation does not match a valid record type in the context of the program.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <typename T>
struct BaseClass {};

template <>
struct DerivedClass<int> : BaseClass<int> {};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <>
struct DerivedClass<int> : NonExistentClass {};
```

In this example, `NonExistentClass` is a type that does not exist, ensuring a mismatch and potential crash related to the base class type deduction. The mutation operator modifies the base class of the template specialization to cause compiler errors related to incorrect or invalid base class types.
