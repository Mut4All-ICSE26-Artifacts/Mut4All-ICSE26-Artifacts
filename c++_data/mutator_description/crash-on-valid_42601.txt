Mutation Operator: Modify Compound Statements in Functions Using std::string_view

Target: This mutation operator targets functions that utilize the std::string_view type within compound statements.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that takes or manipulates a std::string_view. Ensure the function contains a compound statement (e.g., `{}` block).
2. Within the function's compound statement, introduce a temporary std::string_view variable.
3. Assign a substring or a section of an existing std::string_view to the new variable.
4. Use the temporary variable in a subsequent operation, such as a conditional or loop, to ensure its usage spans multiple lines within the compound statement.

Example in Pseudo-Code:
Original Function:
```
void exampleFunction(std::string_view input) {
    if (input.size() > 5) {
        // some operations
    }
}
```

Mutated Function:
```
void exampleFunction(std::string_view input) {
    {
        std::string_view temp_view = input.substr(0, 3);
        if (temp_view.size() > 2) {
            // some operations
        }
    }
}
```

In this mutation, a temporary std::string_view, `temp_view`, is introduced within a new compound statement block. It uses functionality like `substr()` to create derived views, potentially exposing bugs in the compiler's handling of nested compound statements with standard library types like std::string_view.
