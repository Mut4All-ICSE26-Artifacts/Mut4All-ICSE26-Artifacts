Mutation Operator: Undefined Variable in Return Statement

Target Code Construct: Function Return Statement

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function in the seed program that contains a return statement.
2. Within the function, locate or introduce a conditional block (such as an if-else statement).
3. In one branch of the conditional block (preferably the else branch), replace the existing return statement with a return of a variable that is not declared in the current scope.
4. Ensure that the undeclared variable does not match any variable names in the broader scope (e.g., global variables or other accessible scopes) to maintain its undefined nature.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
int exampleFunction() {
    if (condition) {
        return 42;
    } else {
        return value; // value is defined elsewhere
    }
}
```

Mutated:
```
int exampleFunction() {
    if (condition) {
        return 42;
    } else {
        return undefinedVar; // 'undefinedVar' is not declared anywhere
    }
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets the potential weakness in compiler error handling when dealing with return statements that refer to undefined variables. By introducing such a case, it becomes possible to test the compiler's robustness in handling and reporting scope-related errors, particularly in contexts involving conditional logic and return statements.
