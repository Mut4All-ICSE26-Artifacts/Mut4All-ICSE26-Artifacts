Based on the provided bug report, it appears that the crash is triggered by a malformed `requires` clause within a template concept, particularly when there's a syntax error due to a missing comma. This suggests that C++ compiler bugs may be more likely to be triggered by malformed or incomplete syntax in C++20 concepts and clauses. The mutation should focus on altering syntax in ways that are likely to induce similar errors.

Mutation Operator: Misconfiguration of a Concept Requires Clause

Description:
Target a concept or requires clause in a template or a struct. Introduce a syntax error by altering the punctuation or structure of the clause.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a concept or a requires clause in the seed code that uses a valid syntax.
2. Within the requires clause, locate the boundary or separator between two expressions or statements.
3. Remove or replace the separator (e.g., a comma or semicolon) with an incorrect or inappropriate character, or remove it entirely to create a malformed expression.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template<class T>
concept ExampleConcept = requires(T t) { t.operation(); };
```

Mutated Code:
```
template<class T>
concept ExampleConcept = requires(T t) { t.operation() };
```

In this mutation, the semicolon inside the `requires` clause was removed. This change introduces a syntax error, which can lead to unexpected behavior or even a crash in the compiler if it does not handle this malformed syntax correctly.
