Mutation Operator: Incorrect Assignment to Struct

Target Code Construct: Assignment operations involving structure variables

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct type in the seed program. Example: `struct S`.

2. Identify a struct variable of this type. Example: `struct S sx;`.

3. Introduce an assignment operation where the struct variable is assigned a value of an incompatible type, such as an integer or a different struct type. Ensure the assignment occurs in a context where the compiler will evaluate it, such as within a conditional expression or a function call.

4. Example Mutation:
   - Original Code:
     ```
     struct S {
       int a;
     };
     struct S sx;
     ```

   - Mutated Code:
     ```
     struct S {
       int a;
     };
     struct S sx;
     int x = 5;
     sx = x; // Incorrect assignment from int to struct S
     ```

Rationale: This mutation targets incorrect assignments to struct variables, a common source of type-related errors. It exploits the compiler's type-checking mechanisms and is likely to expose issues related to type compatibility handling.
