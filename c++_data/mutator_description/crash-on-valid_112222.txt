Based on the provided bug report, C++ compiler bugs are more likely to be triggered by complex template constructs, especially when involving trailing requires clauses, templates, and out-of-class member function definitions. 

Mutation Operator:
1. Target: Class member functions with trailing requires clause.
2. Mutation Rule: 
   a. Identify a class template with a member function that has a trailing requires clause.
   b. Move the member function definition outside of the class scope (if it is not already).
   c. Modify the requires clause to use different logical conditions that still compile under usual circumstances, such as changing comparisons or logical operators.
   d. Ensure that the modified requires clause is syntactically correct and logically valid. Use existing template parameters and constraints.
   
Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
    void Func() const requires (sizeof(T) > 1);
};

template<typename T>
void MyClass<T>::Func() const requires (sizeof(T) > 1) {
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MyClass {
public:
    void Func() const requires (sizeof(T) > 1);
};

template<typename T>
void MyClass<T>::Func() const requires (sizeof(T) >= 1) {
}
```

In this mutation, the requires clause within the out-of-class definition has been modified from `sizeof(T) > 1` to `sizeof(T) >= 1`. This subtle change, while maintaining logical correctness, can help trigger potential compiler bugs related to constraint evaluation and handling of requires clauses.
