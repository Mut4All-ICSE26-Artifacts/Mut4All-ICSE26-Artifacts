Mutation Operator: Incorrect Use of `constexpr` with Non-Constant Expression

Target Construct: `if constexpr` Statements

Applicable Location: Within function bodies, particularly in control flow constructs like `if constexpr`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an `if constexpr` statement in the seed program.
2. Replace a valid constant expression within the `if constexpr` with a non-constant or undeclared expression to induce a logic error.
3. Ensure that the incorrect expression is syntactically similar to the original one to increase chances of subtle errors.

Example Mutation Process:
- Original Code:
  ```cpp
  constexpr int value = 10;
  if constexpr (value > 5) {
      // Some code
  }
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```cpp
  constexpr int value = 10;
  if constexpr (undeclaredValue > 5) {
      // Some code
  }
  ```

Explanation:
1. Identify `if constexpr (value > 5)` as a target.
2. Replace `value` with `undeclaredValue`, a variable that does not exist in the current scope.
3. This mutation targets the semantic checking phase where the compiler evaluates if constexpr conditions, potentially leading to crashes if assumptions about constness are violated.
