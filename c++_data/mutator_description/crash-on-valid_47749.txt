Mutation Operator: Modify Template Instantiation with Local Lambda

Target Code Construct: Template class instantiation involving local lambdas.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a template class instantiation that involves a local lambda expression. This typically involves code like `using T = Factory<lambda>::Instance<int>;` where `lambda` is defined locally within a function.
2. Alter the lambda to include a capture list, even if empty. For example, change the lambda from `auto lambda = [](auto){}` to `auto lambda = [=](auto){};`.
3. Modify the instantiation to use the lambda with the capture list. Ensure that the capture list syntax `[=]` or `[&]` is included in the lambda definition before using it in any template instantiations.

Example Pseudo-Code:
```
#include <type_traits>

template <auto Lambda>
struct Factory {
  template <typename T>
  using Instance = decltype(Lambda.template operator()<T>(0));
};

int main() {
  // Original lambda
  auto lambda = [](auto){};
  // Mutation: Add capture list
  auto lambdaWithCapture = [=](auto){};
  
  // Original instantiation
  // using T = Factory<lambda>::Instance<int>;
  // Mutation: Use the lambda with capture
  using T = Factory<lambdaWithCapture>::Instance<int>;
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets the use of template instantiation with local lambda functions by introducing capture lists. By altering the lambda to include a capture list, it changes the way the lambda is instantiated and potentially triggers different paths in the compiler's handling of template instantiations and lambda expressions, exposing potential bugs related to lambda captures in template contexts. This simple modification can uncover subtle issues within the compiler's template instantiation and lambda expression handling, as evidenced by the original bug report.
