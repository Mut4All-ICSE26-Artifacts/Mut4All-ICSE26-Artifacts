Mutation Operator 1: Modify Template Usage in Struct

Target: Template Struct Member Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that has a template parameter and a member defined using a templated alias or type.
2. Modify the template usage within the struct by introducing a new member that utilizes the same template alias but with a modification in the template argument.
3. Ensure that the modified template argument is a mathematically valid operation (e.g., addition) on the existing template parameter to maintain valid syntax.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
a. Locate the struct definition that uses a templated type or alias for one of its members.
b. Introduce a new member within the struct that uses the same template alias or type, but alter the template parameter by applying a valid arithmetic operation (such as adding a constant).
c. Ensure the changes are syntactically valid and use existing template parameters or constants.

Example:
Original Code:
template <int AS>
struct EntryTy {
    ASPtrTy<AS> Base;
};

Mutated Code:
template <int AS>
struct EntryTy {
    ASPtrTy<AS> Base;
    ASPtrTy<AS + 1> OffsetBase; // New member using a modified template argument
}
