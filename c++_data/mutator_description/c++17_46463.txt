Mutation Operator: Modify Member Function Access within Type Traits

Target Code Construct: Lambda Expressions and Type Traits (e.g., `std::is_invocable_v`)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify lambda expressions within the code that utilize type traits to infer types or properties. Specifically, look for lambda expressions that attempt to access a member function or variable using `decltype` or similar type deduction mechanisms.
2. Modify the lambda expression to access a non-static member function or variable incorrectly for type deduction. This could involve:
   a. Attempting to access a member function using the `::` operator directly on a type, rather than on an instance of the type.
   b. Changing the context in which `decltype` is used to deduce the return type or property of a member function, leading to misuse of type traits.

Example Transformation:
Original Lambda Expression:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](const auto& cls) -> decltype(
    std::remove_const_t<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(cls)>>::Func()
) {};
```
Mutated Lambda Expression:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](const auto& cls) -> decltype(
    std::remove_const_t<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(cls)>>::NonExistentFunc()
) {};
```
Explanation:
- The mutation operator specifically targets the misuse of the `::` operator to access a non-static member function or variable within a context that requires type inference using type traits.
- By attempting to access a non-existent member function `NonExistentFunc()` directly through the type, the mutation introduces a condition that is likely to cause a compiler crash or an internal compiler error (ICE), thus testing the robustness of the compiler against incorrect type trait usage.
- This mutation operator does not introduce new elements into the seed program but rather modifies existing constructs in a way that is likely to provoke a compiler bug similar to the one described in the bug report.
