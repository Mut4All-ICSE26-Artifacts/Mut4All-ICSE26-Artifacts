Mutation Operator: Function Declaration with Typedef

Target: This mutation operator targets function declarations in the source code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing function declaration within the code.
2. Introduce a typedef for one of the function's argument types outside the function.
3. Change the argument type in the function declaration to use the newly defined typedef.

Steps:
- Locate a function declaration in the code. For instance, if the function is declared as `void myFunction(int a, double b);`
- Introduce a typedef for one of the argument types, preferably a primitive or basic type. For example, `typedef int IntType;`
- Change the argument type in the function declaration to use the typedef. Modify the function to `void myFunction(IntType a, double b);`

Rationale:
Using typedefs can sometimes lead to issues with type resolution in compilers. This mutation operator specifically tests the compiler's ability to handle typedefs in function parameter lists, a situation that may trigger parsing errors or crashes if improperly handled. This operator is designed to be universal and could apply to a wide range of programs that use function declarations.
