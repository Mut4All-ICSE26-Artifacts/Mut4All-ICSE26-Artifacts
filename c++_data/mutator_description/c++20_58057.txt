Mutation Operator: Modify Use of 'using enum' in Combination with Bitwise OR

Target Code Construct: Function bodies where 'using enum' is employed alongside bitwise operations on enumerators.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a 'using enum' declaration in the global or local scope that imports enumerator names into the current namespace.
2. Locate expressions within a function body where these enumerator names are used in bitwise operations, particularly with parentheses.
3. Change the expression using the following steps:
   a. If the expression is within parentheses, remove the parentheses.
   b. Swap the order of the enumerators in the bitwise expression.
   c. Optionally, introduce an inappropriate cast by wrapping the entire expression with a static_cast to an unrelated type, such as a float.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```cpp
using enum Wrap::Things;

int main() {
    int i = (Value1 | Value2);
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
using enum Wrap::Things;

int main() {
    int i = static_cast<float>(Value2 | Value1);
}
```

Explanation: This mutation changes the order of the enumerators involved in the bitwise OR operation and adds a static_cast to an unrelated type, potentially causing unexpected behavior or compiler crashes when the mutated code involves type conversions or optimizations related to enumeration values.
