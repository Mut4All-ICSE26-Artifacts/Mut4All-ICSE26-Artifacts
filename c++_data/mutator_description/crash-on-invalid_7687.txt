Mutation Operator: Misplaced Preprocessor Directives in Function Bodies

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets function bodies, specifically inserting or moving preprocessor directives within them.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function with an existing body in the seed program.
2. Select a random location within the function body where no preprocessor directives currently exist.
3. Insert a preprocessor directive, such as `#include`, `#define`, or `#ifdef`, at the chosen location.
4. Ensure that the directive is syntactically correct but contextually misplaced, as preprocessor directives are generally expected outside of function bodies.

Example Application (in pseudo-code):
Original function:
```
int compute(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

Mutated function:
```
int compute(int a, int b) {
    #include <iostream>
    return a + b;
}
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, a preprocessor directive `#include <iostream>` is placed within the function body of `compute`. This is unusual and may trigger unexpected behavior or crashes in compilers that do not handle such scenarios robustly. The directive is placed inside the body to specifically test the compiler's handling of misplaced preprocessor directives.
