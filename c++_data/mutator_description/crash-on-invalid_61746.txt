Mutation Operator: Modify Union Initialization

1. Target: This mutation operator targets union declarations in C++ code.

2. Mutation Rule: 
   - Identify a union declaration that includes an array member, similar to the structure in the bug report.
   - Modify the initialization of the union such that the initializer does not match the type or form expected by the union member.

3. Steps:
   a. Locate a union in the code with at least one member being an array, for example:
      ```cpp
      union ExampleUnion { char arr[10]; int num; } exampleVar;
      ```
   b. Change the initialization of the union to initialize it with a type or value that does not match the expected array type. For instance:
      ```cpp
      union ExampleUnion { char arr[10]; int num; } exampleVar = { 12345 };
      ```
   c. This step introduces a situation where the initializer type (integer) does not directly map to the expected type of the union array member, potentially causing a crash during compilation.

4. Applicability: This mutation operator is applicable in C++ codebases that utilize unions with array members and can be adapted to various code seeds due to the common use of such structures in handling multiple data types within a single memory footprint.
