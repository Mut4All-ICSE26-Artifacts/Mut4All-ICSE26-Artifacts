Mutation Operator: Annotation Token Misuse

Target Construct: Annotation Token Usage in Functions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function definition within the seed program.
2. Locate a token within the function body where a variable assignment or operation occurs.
3. Change the token to an unexpected annotation token. For example, if there is a variable assignment like `int a = 5;`, change it to something like `@annotation = 5;`.
4. Ensure that this annotation token is not declared or defined anywhere in the seed program, simulating an unexpected and unsupported usage of annotations in the context of the function body.
5. Compile the modified program and observe for crashes in the C++ compiler due to the unexpected annotation token usage.

This mutation operator exploits the potential mishandling of annotation tokens by the compiler, which could lead to assertion failures as described in the bug report.
