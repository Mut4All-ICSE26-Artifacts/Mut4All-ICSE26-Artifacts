Mutation Operator: Modify consteval Conversion Operator

Target Construct: User-defined conversion operators within a struct or class.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a user-defined conversion operator in a struct or class declaration. The operator should be marked with the `consteval` keyword.
2. Remove the `consteval` keyword from the conversion operator.
3. Ensure that other parts of the user-defined conversion operator remain unchanged.
4. Example Pseudo-code:
   Original:
   ```
   struct Example {
      consteval operator double() { return 2.0; }
   };
   ```
   Mutated:
   ```
   struct Example {
      operator double() { return 2.0; }
   };
   ```
5. Ensure the struct or class is instantiated or utilized in a way that triggers the conversion, such as through assignment or initialization.

Rationale: The presence of `consteval` in conversion operators can lead to specific evaluation paths in the compiler that may be prone to bugs, especially if the compiler is not handling such paths correctly, as evidenced by the provided bug report. By removing `consteval`, we test if the compiler correctly processes the operation without the requirement for compile-time evaluation, potentially triggering different behavior or revealing other bugs.
