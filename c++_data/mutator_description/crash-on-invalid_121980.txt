Mutation Operator: Modify Template Concept Usage

Target Code Construct:
The mutation targets template concepts used in conjunction with structs and template specializations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template concept declaration that is used as a constraint for a struct or template specialization.
2. Change the template concept usage in the struct or specialization to a syntactically incorrect or incomplete form. For example, remove a required identifier or symbol in the concept usage.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template <class T>
concept MyConcept = requires(T a) { a.member_function(); };

template <MyConcept T>
struct ExampleStruct { };
```

Mutated Code:
```
template <class T>
concept MyConcept = requires(T a) { a.member_function(); };

template <MyConcept> // Removed the identifier T
struct ExampleStruct { };
```

Explanation:
The mutation operator targets the usage of template concepts in structs or specialized templates. By removing a required identifier when specifying the concept constraint, we induce a syntactic form that is invalid. This will likely trigger assertion failures or other parsing errors in the compiler, especially if the constraint checking is not robust against such syntax errors. This mutation has wide applicability across various codebases utilizing concepts with templates.
