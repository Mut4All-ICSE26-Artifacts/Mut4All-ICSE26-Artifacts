Mutation Operator: Modify Consteval Constructor Invocation

Target Code Construct: Consteval Constructor within Struct Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct with a consteval constructor that invokes a constexpr function.
2. Modify the invocation of the constexpr function within the consteval constructor by introducing a call to another constexpr function. Ensure this additional function is pre-declared in the program.
3. The additional constexpr function should return a value or have a void return type but must not be a no-operation (noop); it should perform a minimal operation, such as returning a constant value or performing a simple arithmetic operation.

Example:
Original Code:
```
extern constexpr void func();

struct S {
  consteval S() { func(); }
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
extern constexpr void func();
extern constexpr int additionalFunc() { return 42; }

struct S {
  consteval S() { func(); additionalFunc(); }
};
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the initialization behavior of consteval constructors within structs, aiming to explore potential compiler crashes related to the sequence and complexity of constexpr function calls. By adding an additional constexpr function call, the mutation increases the coverage of code paths in the compiler's constant expression interpreter, potentially exposing assertion failures or other bugs.
