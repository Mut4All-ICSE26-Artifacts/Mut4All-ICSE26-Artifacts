Mutation Operator: Incorrect Enum Usage with Binary Operator Overload

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets `enum` declarations and their misuse with binary operators in the context of operator overloading.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an `enum` declaration within the C++ code. The `enum` should be declared but not necessarily contain any enumerators.
2. Identify a location within the code where an assignment operation using a binary operator (e.g., `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.) is applied to an `enum` variable or directly to the `enum` type itself.
3. Replace this operation with an incorrect attempt to use a binary operator on the `enum`, simulating the misuse of operator overloading with an incomplete or incorrect operation.
4. Ensure the operation is syntactically incorrect to trigger a compiler crash, such as by using a string literal or incompatible type with the operator.

Example:
Original Code:
```
enum Status { READY, RUNNING, STOPPED };
Status currentStatus = READY;
// Some operations with currentStatus
```

Mutated Code:
```
enum Status { READY, RUNNING, STOPPED };
Status currentStatus = READY;
currentStatus += ""; // Intentionally incorrect use of binary operator with enum and string literal
```

This mutation operator exploits erroneous binary operator usage with enums that should lead to compiler errors or crashes when the compiler attempts to resolve the invalid operation. The example illustrates the typical misuse by combining an `enum` with a string literal using the `+=` operator, which is not valid for enums.
