Mutation Operator: Incomplete Struct Destructor Call

Target Code Construct:
This mutation targets destructors of structs within a function. It specifically applies to cases where a struct is forward declared but not fully defined before its destructor is called.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a forward-declared struct within a function scope. A forward-declaration is a declaration of the struct without a complete definition (i.e., missing the body).
2. Locate any calls to the destructor of this forward-declared struct within the same function.
3. Ensure that the destructor call occurs before a complete definition of the struct is provided within the function. This setup should mimic a situation where the destructor is invoked without the compiler having access to the complete struct definition.

Example:
Original Code:
```
void func() {
    struct MyStruct;
    MyStruct::~MyStruct();
}
```

After Mutation:
- The above code already demonstrates the intended mutation where the destructor `~MyStruct()` is called without a preceding complete definition of `MyStruct`.

Rationale:
This mutation operator triggers issues related to incomplete type usage in C++ compilers by attempting to use a destructor before the type is fully defined, which is a common source of crashing bugs in the frontend of compilers due to incomplete type contexts. It ensures compiler robustness by testing how the compiler handles incomplete type situations.
