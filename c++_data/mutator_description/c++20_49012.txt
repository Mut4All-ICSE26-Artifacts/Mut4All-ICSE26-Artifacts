Mutation Operator: Modify CRTP with Consteval and Static Cast

Target Code Construct: Templates using CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) with `consteval` and `static_cast`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template using CRTP, where a derived class is casting the base class pointer/reference to the derived class using `static_cast`.
2. Ensure the method where the cast happens is marked as `consteval`.
3. Modify the cast from `static_cast<Derived>(*this)` to `static_cast<Derived*>(this)`, or vice versa, depending on the existing code pattern.
4. If the method isn't already marked as `consteval`, add the `consteval` specifier to the function definition.

Example:
Given the following pseudo-code using CRTP:

```
template<typename Derived>
class Base {
public:
    consteval Derived getDerived() {
        return static_cast<Derived>(*this);
    }
};

class Derived : public Base<Derived> {
    // Implementation details
};
```

Apply mutation:
1. Change the static cast in `consteval` method from `static_cast<Derived>(*this)` to `static_cast<Derived*>(this)` as follows:

```
template<typename Derived>
class Base {
public:
    consteval Derived* getDerived() {
        return static_cast<Derived*>(this);
    }
};

class Derived : public Base<Derived> {
    // Implementation details
};
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the interplay between CRTP and `consteval` in the context of static casting. By altering the type of cast from object reference to pointer or vice versa, this operator exploits potential mishandlings in type conversion semantics within the compiler, especially under the constraints of `consteval` executions. This mutation is designed to stress-test the compiler's handling of `consteval` functions and template-based type casting, potentially revealing weaknesses in code paths less frequently exercised.
