Mutation Operator: Modify Nested Template Requirements

Target Code Construct: Template class with concept constraints

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template struct or class definition that uses concept constraints. In this case, the target is the `struct A` which has specializations with constraints `C1<T>` and `C1<T> && C2<T>`.
2. Modify the concept constraints in a way that involves altering the nested template type requirement. This can be done by changing the level of nesting or the template structure.
3. Specifically, change the constraints on the template parameter to require different nested template behavior than originally specified.

Example Mutation Steps:
- In the structure `struct A` with `requires C1<T> && C2<T>`, change the constraints to introduce a new hypothetical concept `C3` that slightly alters the expected behavior of the template parameters, like follows:
  
  Original:
  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  requires C1<T> && C2<T>
  struct A<T>
  {};
  ```
  
  Mutated:
  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  requires C1<T> && C3<T>
  struct A<T>
  {};
  ```

- Ensure `C3` is defined as a concept that utilizes the nested template in a different manner or references a different property of the template type, such as:
  
  ```cpp
  template <class T>
  concept C3 = requires (T& t)
  {
    requires sizeof(T::template another_type) >= 0;
  };
  ```

Note: The mutation introduces a new concept `C3` that interacts with a nested template type. The intention is to perturb the expectations of the template system, potentially triggering different pathways in the compiler frontend responsible for template specialization.
