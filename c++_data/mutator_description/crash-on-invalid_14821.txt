Mutation Operator: Incorrect Template Specialization

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets function calls involving template specialization and inheritance.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template that takes a template-derived type as its parameter, such as `void f(B<const T> p)`.
2. Modify the function call to use a template specialization that is not explicitly handled by the function. This can involve altering the type parameters involved in the function call.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a function template in the code that uses a template-derived type in its parameter list.
- Change the type used in the function call to a specialized type that is not directly covered by the existing function templates.
- Ensure that the replacement type is syntactically valid but leads to a mismatch or unsupported scenario.

Example:
Consider a function template defined as `template<class T> void f(B<const T> p);`
Mutation:
- Original call: `f(B<int>());`
- Mutated call: `f(B<double*>());`

In this mutation, the function `f` is called with `B<double*>`, which may introduce complexities or edge cases not directly anticipated in the original function template design, potentially leading to compilation issues or crashes if not correctly managed.
