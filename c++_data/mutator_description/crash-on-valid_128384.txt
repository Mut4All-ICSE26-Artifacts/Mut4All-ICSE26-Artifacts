Mutation Operator: Preprocessor Directive Manipulation

Target: Preprocessor directives within a C++ source file.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing `#if`, `#ifdef`, or `#ifndef` preprocessor directive in the source code.
2. If the directive uses a macro or a predefined macro check, replace the entire condition with a more complex expression that combines multiple macros using logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
3. Ensure that at least one of the macros is undefined in the current compilation context.
4. If necessary, introduce new `#define` and `#undef` preprocessor directives for the involved macros to ensure some are defined and some are not, but with different logical states.
5. Apply the changes and verify the mutated preprocessor block for syntactical consistency.

Example Pseudo-Code:
Initial Code:
```
#ifdef FEATURE_ENABLED
int someFunction() { return 1; }
#else
int someFunction() { return 0; }
#endif
```

Mutated Code:
```
#if defined(FEATURE_ENABLED) && !defined(UNUSED_MACRO)
#define UNUSED_MACRO
#undef FEATURE_ENABLED
int someFunction() { return 1; }
#else
#undef UNUSED_MACRO
#define FEATURE_ENABLED
int someFunction() { return 0; }
#endif
```

This mutation operator targets the preprocessing phase of compilation, specifically the handling of conditional compilation directives. By introducing a mix of defined and undefined macros, it tests the compiler's ability to correctly resolve complex conditions and can potentially trigger issues in the preprocessing logic.
