Mutation Operator: Recursive Class Member Removal

Target Code Construct: Class Definitions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify class definitions within the code. Focus on classes that have member variables of the same type as the class itself.
2. Locate any member within the class that is declared as an instance of the class itself (e.g., a member variable of type `foo` inside class `foo`).
3. Remove or comment out the recursive member variable declaration within the class.

Example:
Original Code:
```
class Bar {
  Bar b;
  int someFunction();
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
class Bar {
  // Bar b; // Removed or commented out the recursive member
  int someFunction();
};
```

This mutation reduces recursive member definition that can cause incomplete type errors, particularly at compile time, and can often lead to crashes if not handled correctly by the compiler. Such mutations are crucial in testing the robustness of the compiler's ability to handle incomplete type scenarios gracefully.
