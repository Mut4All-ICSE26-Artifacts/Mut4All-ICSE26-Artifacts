Mutation Operator

Target: Template Structures

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a template declaration involving a struct or class. This could be a template that defines a data structure, such as a class or struct.
2. Insert a new type alias within the template that uses `typename` with an incomplete or incorrect type expression. This is intended to confuse the type resolution in the compiler.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Identify the template declaration. For example, `template <typename T> struct MyStruct { ... };`.
- Within the template body, introduce a type alias using `typename` with an incomplete type, such as `typename IncompleteType;`.
- The incomplete type declaration should be placed just after the template's initial statements but before any usage of the template parameters or member functions.

Example:
Original:
```
template <typename T>
struct MyContainer {
    T data;
    void processData();
};
```

Mutated:
```
template <typename T>
struct MyContainer {
    typename IncompleteType;
    T data;
    void processData();
};
```

This mutation is designed to stress test the compiler's handling of type resolutions and incomplete type declarations within templates, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior during compilation.
