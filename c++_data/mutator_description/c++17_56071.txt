Mutation Operator: Modify Variadic Template Argument Expansion

Target: Variadic template functions or expressions involving variadic template arguments.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a variadic template function or expression in the seed program. This typically involves a function template that takes a parameter pack, e.g., `template <typename F, typename... Ts>`.
2. Within the function body, locate a variadic expansion. This is usually characterized by an expression like `((Ts{}, f1(f)), ...)`.
3. Introduce an additional layer of nesting or a transformation within the variadic expansion to increase complexity. For example, wrap the current expression with an additional lambda or modify the structure of the expression in a way that utilizes the captured variables or other available functions.

Example Mutation:
Original Variadic Expansion:
```cpp
((Ts{}, f1(f)), ...);
```

Mutated Expansion:
```cpp
([](auto... args) { ((args, f1(f)), ...); }(Ts{}...));
```

Explanation:
- The mutation introduces an additional lambda that captures all the variadic arguments (`Ts{}...`) and applies the existing variadic operation within this new context. This transformation increases the expression's complexity and may trigger variations in template instantiation and lambda handling, potentially uncovering compiler issues related to variadic templates and lambdas.
