Mutation Operator: Misplaced Access Specifier in Class Definition

Target Code Construct:
This mutation targets class definitions specifically focusing on member declarations within the class, such as functions, variables, enums, etc.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class definition within the seed program. The class should contain at least one member function or variable declaration.
2. Choose a member function or variable within the class.
3. Insert an access specifier (such as public, private, or protected) within the parameter list of a member function or variable inappropriately. This involves placing the specifier where it does not logically belong, such as between formal parameters or in the middle of an enum or variable declaration.
4. Ensure that the access specifier is not removed after insertion.

Example:
Given the seed code:
```
class Example {
    void foo(int a, int b);
    int x;
};
```

Apply the mutation:
```
class Example {
    void foo(int a, private int b);
    int x;
};
```

Explanation:
The mutation involves introducing an inappropriate access specifier within the parameter list of the function `foo`. This deviates from the expected syntax and structure, potentially triggering compiler issues related to access control mechanisms. This method leverages existing variables and function parameters to introduce the mutated behavior without declaring new types or variables, ensuring broad applicability and increased likelihood of compiler failure.
