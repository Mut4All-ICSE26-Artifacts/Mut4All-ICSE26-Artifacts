Mutation Operator: Template Specialization Misconfiguration

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets class template specializations within C++ code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template in the seed program. For example:
   ```cpp
   template<typename T>
   class MyClass {
       // Class members
   };
   ```

2. Introduce a partial specialization for the class template that conflicts with an already defined one. If no specialization exists, create a conflicting one.

3. Step-by-step mutation:
   a. Locate any existing partial specialization or define a generic one:
      ```cpp
      template<>
      class MyClass<int> {
          // Specialized members
      };
      ```

   b. Introduce a conflicting partial specialization:
      ```cpp
      template<typename T>
      class MyClass<T*> {
          // Conflicting specialized members
      };
      ```

4. Ensure that the partial specialization involves a condition that overlaps with another specialization or the primary template. This conflict is designed to confuse the compiler's specialization selection process, potentially triggering a crash.

5. Test the mutation by compiling the program to ensure the mutation effectively induces the expected compiler behavior.

By applying this mutation, testers can assess how the compiler manages conflicting or overlapping template specializations, potentially revealing weaknesses in its handling of invalid or ambiguous template constructs.
