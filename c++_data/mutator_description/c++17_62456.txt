Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Capture and Fold Expression

Target Construct: Lambda expressions and fold expressions within lambda captures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a lambda expression in the source code. For example, a lambda defined as `auto lambda = [](auto... a) { return ([a]{}, ..., 0); };`.
2. Modify the lambda capture list to include an additional captured variable or parameter from the surrounding scope. If no such variable exists, introduce a new integer variable in the outer scope and capture it.
3. Change the fold expression by replacing the current operation with a different binary operation, such as switching from a comma operator to an addition operator.
4. For seed programs where no suitable variables exist, declare a new integer variable `int x = 42;` in the surrounding scope and include it in the lambda capture list.

Example Mutation:
Original:
```cpp
int i = [](auto) { return [](auto... a) { return ([a]{}, ..., 0); }; }(0)();
```
Mutated:
```cpp
int x = 42;
int i = [x](auto) { return [](auto... a) { return (([a]{}, x) + ...); }; }(0)();
```

In this mutation, the lambda expression's capture list is modified to include `x`, and the fold expression is altered by changing the fold operator from a comma to an addition. This adjustment can potentially expose compiler bugs related to lambda captures and fold expressions.
