Mutation Operator: Defaulted Assignment with Explicit Object Parameter

Target Construct: Struct and Defaulted Special Member Functions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that has inherited from a base struct or class.
2. In the derived struct, add a defaulted assignment operator function.
3. Explicitly use the ‘this’ keyword referring to a parameter of a base type, which is non-standard.
4. Ensure the derived struct has at least one data member (e.g., an integer, float, etc.).
5. Attempt to perform an assignment operation involving an instance of the derived struct within a function to trigger the compiler's behavior.

Example:
Original Code: 
```cpp
struct BaseClass {};
struct DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    int member;
};

void exampleFunction() {
    DerivedClass instance;
    //...
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct BaseClass {};
struct DerivedClass : BaseClass {
    int member;
    DerivedClass& operator=(this BaseClass& self, const DerivedClass&) = default;
};

void exampleFunction() {
    DerivedClass instance;
    instance = instance;
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the use of defaulted assignment operators with explicit object parameters, which can push the limits of compiler capabilities, especially when combined with inheritance hierarchies. The explicit use of `this` with a base type in defaulted functions is a recent addition and might not be fully supported or might lead to unexpected behavior, thereby testing the robustness of the compiler.
