Mutation Operator

Target: Function Attributes

Mutation Rule: Modify the usage of attributes within function declarations. Specifically target attributes that accept arguments and alter their structure or values.

Steps:
1. Identify a function declaration in the seed program that uses attributes, particularly those that accept arguments (e.g., [[clang::annotate()]]).
2. Alter the arguments given to the attribute. For instance, if the attribute takes multiple nested expressions as arguments, modify their structure or type.
3. Ensure that the modified arguments are syntactically valid but have altered expression types or structures that may not be anticipated by the compiler. For example, if the original was [[clang::annotate("test", (9, (void)T{}))]], change it to [[clang::annotate("test", (9, T{}))]] or [[clang::annotate("test", 9 + T{})]].
4. If the attribute accepts a list of expressions, change the number of expressions provided, such as removing or duplicating elements, while maintaining syntactically valid code.
5. If new expressions are introduced, ensure they are derived from existing types or variables within the seed program to maintain compatibility.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original:
template<typename T>
struct A {
  [[clang::annotate("note", (1, T{}))]] void f() {}
};

Mutated:
template<typename T>
struct A {
  [[clang::annotate("note", (T{} + 5))]] void f() {}
};
