Mutation Operator: Template Template Argument Mutation

Target Construct: Template Definitions with Constrained Non-Type Template Parameters (NTTPs)

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template that uses constrained non-type template parameters, such as "template<template<C auto...> typename Templ>".
2. Modify the parameter list to introduce a variation in constraints, such as adding or changing a constraint in the concept.
3. If the original concept is applied to the template argument (e.g., "C auto"), change it to a different concept or add an additional constraint for testing purposes.
4. Ensure the new concept also resolves to true to maintain syntactic correctness while testing the constraint handling logic.

Example Transformation:
Original:
```
template<typename T>
concept C = true;

template<template<C auto...> typename Templ>
struct template_ {};
```
Mutated:
```
template<typename T>
concept D = true;

template<template<D auto...> typename Templ>
struct template_ {};
```

Explanation:
By altering the concept used in the template argument, we can test how the compiler handles changes in template constraints. This mutation is particularly effective for revealing issues in the constraint checking mechanisms of the compiler and is widely applicable to any template using constrained NTTPs.
