Mutation Operator: Modify Template Class Inheritance with Concept Constraints

Target: Template classes with concept constraints, especially those using CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class that inherits from a base class using the CRTP pattern.
2. Add a new concept constraint to enforce stricter conditions on the template parameters.
3. Modify the instantiation process to introduce a condition where the concept might not be satisfied, leading to potential assertion failures.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Locate the template class that uses CRTP, e.g., `Derived` class inheriting from `Base<T, Derived<T>>`.
2. Add a new concept constraint to the template class. For example, enforce that `T` must satisfy a new or existing concept, such as `std::integral`.
3. Ensure that the instantiation of this template class violates the newly introduced concept constraint. This can be done by changing the template argument to a type that does not satisfy the constraint.

Example:
Original Code:
```
template <typename T>
class Derived final : public Base<T, Derived<T>> {};
```

Mutated Code:
```
#include <type_traits>

// Define a new concept
template <typename T>
concept IntegralOrFloating = std::is_integral_v<T> || std::is_floating_point_v<T>;

template <typename T>
requires IntegralOrFloating<T>  // Add a concept constraint
class Derived final : public Base<T, Derived<T>> {};

// Attempt to instantiate with a non-integral, non-floating-point type
Derived<std::string> myDerivedInstance;  // This should trigger the bug
```

By introducing a concept constraint and instantiating with an incompatible type, this mutation operator aims to explore the boundaries of template constraints and concept satisfaction, potentially triggering assertion failures due to unmet conditions.
