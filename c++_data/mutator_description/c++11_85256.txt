Mutation Operator:
Target: C++ class constructors, specifically with base class initializers and inheritance hierarchy.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class that inherits from a base class. This class should have an explicit constructor that initializes its base class using an initializer list.
2. Modify the order of base class initializers or introduce an incorrect type for one of the base class members in the derived class constructor's initializer list. This should be done without altering the overall class hierarchy.
3. Ensure that the base class has multiple members or subobjects, and rearrange their initialization order in the derived class's constructor.
4. If the base class contains members of different types, attempt to initialize them with values of incorrect or incompatible types during the mutation.

Example (Pseudo-code):
Original code:
```
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x, double y) : member1(x), member2(y) {}
private:
    int member1;
    double member2;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() : Base(10, 2.5) {}  // Correct initialization
};
```

Mutated code:
```
class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived() : Base(2.5, 10) {}  // Mutated initialization, incorrect order and incompatible types
};
```

This mutation operator targets scenarios where C++ constructors, especially involving inheritance and member initialization, might not maintain the expected order or type compatibility, potentially triggering compiler bugs related to constructor calls and initialization order.
