Based on the bug report provided, the issue involves the use of an r-value of `initializer_list` with `begin()`, which leads to a compiler crash. This suggests that certain C++ standard library features, especially those involving r-values and initializer lists, can trigger bugs in the compiler. To design a mutation operator that might reproduce similar issues, we can focus on modifying code structures related to r-values and initializer lists, especially in conjunction with standard library functions that operate on iterators.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Scope with Standard Library Use

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a seed program where an `initializer_list` is used, particularly within a function scope.
2. Replace the regular use of `initializer_list` with an r-value `initializer_list` and immediately invoke a member function that returns an iterator (such as `begin()` or `end()`).
3. Ensure that the `initializer_list` is directly used in an expression without being assigned to a variable.

Example:
Original Seed Code (pseudo-code):
```
void exampleFunction() {
    std::initializer_list<int> values = {1, 2, 3};
    auto it = values.begin();
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    auto it = std::initializer_list<int>({1, 2, 3}).begin();
}
```

In this mutation, the `initializer_list` is directly created as an r-value, and `begin()` is immediately called on it. This mutation targets the r-value initializer list usage with an iterator function call, which is similar to the context described in the bug report. By replacing a regular use with an r-value use, we aim to explore potential edge cases in the compiler's handling of such constructs.
