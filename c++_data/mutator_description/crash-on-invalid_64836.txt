Mutation Operator: Invalid Syntax in Member Declaration

Target Code Construct: Class Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class declaration within the seed program.
2. Within the class, locate a member declaration segment (public, private, or protected section).
3. Introduce an invalid token or incomplete syntax within this segment, such as an undeclared identifier or incomplete statement.
4. Ensure the invalid syntax is positioned such that it disrupts a valid member declaration (e.g., directly before a datatype or identifier).
5. Avoid introducing syntax that leads to immediate corrective suggestions by the compiler, targeting more subtle errors that trigger deeper parsing issues.

Example of Mutation:
Original:
```cpp
class SampleClass {
public:
    int memberVariable;
    void memberFunction();
};
```

Mutated:
```cpp
class SampleClass {
public:
    x          // Introduces an undeclared identifier, causing invalid syntax
    int memberVariable;
    void memberFunction();
};
```

This mutation operator leverages the introduction of subtle syntax errors in member declarations to test the compiler's ability to handle unexpected tokens within structured class bodies, potentially leading to parsing errors or crashes.
