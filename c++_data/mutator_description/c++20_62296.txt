Mutation Operator: Modify Using Declarations in Derived Classes

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets `using` declarations within derived classes in C++ programs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `using` declaration in a derived class that inherits from a base class, specifically one that specifies member access from the base class.
2. Remove the member specification after the scope resolution operator (`::`) to mimic an incomplete member access, which can lead to compiler crashes or errors.

Example:
Original Seed Program:
```
struct Base {
protected:
    void someFunction();
};

struct Derived : Base {
    using Base::someFunction; // Correct using declaration
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.someFunction();
}
```

Mutated Program:
```
struct Base {
protected:
    void someFunction();
};

struct Derived : Base {
    using Base::; // Introduced mutation by removing the member name
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    d.someFunction();
}
```

Explanation:
This mutation exploits potential weaknesses in compiler handling of incomplete `using` declarations. By removing the member identifier after the scope resolution operator, the mutation introduces a syntactic error that might not be gracefully handled by the compiler, leading to crashes or incorrect error messages. This mutation targets the parser's ability to handle erroneous or incomplete syntax in the context of access declarations.
