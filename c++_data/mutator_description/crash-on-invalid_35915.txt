Mutation Operator:
Target: Function Template Instantiation with Lambdas

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any function template instantiation that involves lambda expressions in the source code.
2. Insert an additional lambda expression as an argument to a templated function call where the original function does not expect additional arguments. This lambda should capture some variables from the surrounding scope.
3. Ensure the lambda includes some complex logic or multiple statements to increase the chance of interaction with other template parameters.
4. For any variables captured by the lambda, use existing variables from the surrounding scope instead of introducing new ones.
5. If necessary, change the return type or parameters of the lambda to match the function template's expected types.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
void execute(T func) {
    func();
}

int main() {
    auto lambda = []() { /* some logic */ };
    execute(lambda);
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
void execute(T func) {
    func();
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    auto lambda = [x]() { /* some logic */ };
    execute(lambda);

    // Mutation: Adding an unexpected lambda
    execute([&x]() { x += 5; /* some complex logic */ });
}
```

This mutation operator targets the template instantiation process, particularly focusing on the interaction between lambdas and function templates, which may lead to unexpected behavior in the compiler's type inference and instantiation process, potentially triggering crashes as seen in the bug report.
