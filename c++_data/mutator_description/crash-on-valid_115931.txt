Based on the provided bug report, it appears that the C++ compiler crash is related to the handling of lambda expressions, particularly in the context of generic lambdas and capture mechanisms. From the analysis, it can be inferred that C++ compiler bugs are likely to be triggered by complex lambda expressions, especially when dealing with multiple nested or generic lambdas that capture variables.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Lambda expressions, particularly nested or generic lambdas with variable captures.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression within the code that captures one or more variables.
2. Modify the lambda to become a generic lambda by adding a template parameter list (e.g., `template<typename T>`).
3. Introduce another lambda expression inside the existing lambda, creating a nested lambda structure.
4. Ensure that the nested lambda captures variables from the outer lambda, potentially leading to capture conflicts or ambiguities.
5. The new nested lambda should also be a generic lambda, using a different template parameter from the outer lambda.

Example Pseudo-code:
Original Code:
```cpp
auto lambda = [x]() { return x + 1; };
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
auto outerLambda = [x](auto y) {
    return [y](auto z) {
        return x + y + z;
    };
};
```

Explanation:
- The mutation involves transforming a simple lambda into a nested structure with both outer and inner lambdas being generic.
- By introducing template parameters and nested lambdas with captures, the complexity of the lambda's capture and instantiation context increases, potentially triggering compiler bugs related to lambda capture and template instantiation handling.
- This mutation specifically targets issues with generic lambdas and captures, as evidenced by the bug details provided.
