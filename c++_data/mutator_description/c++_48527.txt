Mutation Operator: Modify Attribute Syntax in Lambda Functions

Target Construct: Lambda Functions with Attributes

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda function in the source code. This function should include the use of attributes, preferably with non-standard or compiler-specific syntax.
2. Focus on the attribute section of the lambda function. For example, in this code:
   ```cpp
   auto lambdaFunc = []() __attribute__((custom_attribute)) {
       return 1;
   };
   ```
3. Introduce a malformed or syntactically misleading attribute. Specifically, modify the attribute by introducing invalid characters or incorrect nesting, such as using parentheses or braces unnecessarily.
4. For instance, replace the attribute section with something like:
   ```cpp
   auto lambdaFunc = []() __attribute__((custom_attribute({}))) {
       return 1;
   };
   ```
5. Ensure that the modified attribute still appears as an attribute to the lambda, but with an incorrect or unexpected syntax that might confuse the compiler's parsing logic.

This mutation operator targets the lambda function's attribute handling, which can frequently expose weaknesses in how the compiler parses and processes attributes, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior. The focus on attributes, especially with incorrect syntax, leverages the potential for bugs similar to those observed in the provided bug report.
