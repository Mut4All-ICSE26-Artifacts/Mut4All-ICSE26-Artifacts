Mutation Operator: Modify Template Specialization with Non-deducible Template Argument

- Target: This mutation operator is specifically designed for template specializations, particularly when a substitution failure can occur due to non-deducible template arguments.

- Mutation Rule:
  1. Identify a template function or class in the code that uses SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error) with `enable_if` or a similar mechanism to control template specialization based on a condition.
  2. Introduce an additional template parameter to the function or class that is not deducible from the function call. This will force the template instantiation to fail if the additional parameter is not explicitly provided.
  3. Ensure that the new template parameter is integrated into the SFINAE condition, affecting the instantiation logic.

- Example:
  In the context of the provided bug report, we notice the use of `enable_if` with `always_false` to control specialization. We can modify this with a non-deducible template parameter as follows:

  Original Code:
  ```cpp
  template<typename T, typename = typename enable_if<always_false<T>>::type>
  void data(T);
  ```

  Mutated Code:
  ```cpp
  template<typename T, typename U, typename = typename enable_if<always_false<T>>::type>
  void data(T);
  ```

  - Explanation: The additional template parameter `U` is introduced but not used in the function signature. This complicates the template deduction process, as `U` must be provided explicitly during instantiation.

- Application: This mutation operator can be applied broadly across different seed programs that utilize template specialization with SFINAE, ensuring high coverage and potential for triggering subtle compiler issues related to template deduction and instantiation.
