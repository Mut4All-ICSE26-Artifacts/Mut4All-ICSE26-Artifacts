Mutation Operator: Modify Parenthesized Initializer List for Complex Typing

Target Code Construct: Initializer List in Constructors or Complex Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a constructor or function that uses a parenthesized initializer list, particularly with complex or nested types, such as `std::initializer_list` or custom classes.
2. Replace the initializer list with an expression that mixes types not directly compatible with each other within the initializer context.
3. Add an extra layer of parentheses around the entire initializer list to simulate a `CXXParenListInitExpr`.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a constructor or expression such as:
  ```cpp
  MyClass obj({1, 2, 3});
  ```
- Modify the initializer list by adding incompatible types and an additional parenthesis layer:
  ```cpp
  MyClass obj((1, "text", 3.0));
  ```

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    MyStruct(std::initializer_list<int> list) {}
};

int main() {
    MyStruct obj({1, 2, 3});
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    MyStruct(std::initializer_list<int> list) {}
};

int main() {
    MyStruct obj(({1, "text", 3.0})); // Note the extra parentheses and mixed types
}
```

Note: This mutation operator exploits potential issues in handling parenthesized initializer lists with mixed types, which could trigger unexpected behavior in compilers when managing type conversions and initializations. This mutation is adapted to stress the initialization process, which is relevant given the nature of the bug report involving `CXXParenListInitExpr`.
