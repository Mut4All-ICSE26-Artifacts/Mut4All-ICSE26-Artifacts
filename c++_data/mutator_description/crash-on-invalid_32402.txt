Mutation Operator: Misplaced Brackets in Arrays

Target Code Construct: Array Declarations within Compound Statements

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify array declarations within any compound statement (`{}`) in the code.
2. Within the array declaration, locate the array size specification, which is typically enclosed in square brackets `[]`.
3. Mutate the array size specification by misplacing the closing bracket `]`. For example, place it after a subsequent token such as a variable name, instead of immediately following the size expression. This creates an erroneous array declaration that may trigger parsing issues.

Example Illustration:
Original Code:
```
{
    int myArray[10];
    // Other statements
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
{
    int myArray[10] someVariable;
    // Other statements
}
```

Note: In this mutation, ensure that the misplaced bracket leads to a syntactically incorrect statement. The mutation should be applied in a context that supports array declarations, and the potential for triggering a compiler crash or error message is increased due to the structural anomaly introduced.
