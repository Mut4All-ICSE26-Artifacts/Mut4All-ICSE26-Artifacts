Mutation Operator: Modify Pointer-to-Member Expressions

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets pointer-to-member expressions within class or struct definitions. It specifically modifies how these expressions are used within member function definitions or assignments.

Precise Mutation Rule:

1. Identify the use of pointer-to-member expressions within member functions of a class or struct.
2. Modify the pointer-to-member expression by introducing an additional level of indirection or changing its context of use.

Step-by-step Instructions:

- Locate a member function within a class or struct that utilizes a pointer-to-member expression. This could be a data member or a member function of the class or struct.
- Introduce an additional level of indirection by adding an extra pointer dereference or use of the address-of operator as part of the expression.
- Ensure that the modification maintains syntactic validity, but alters the expression in a way that could interact differently with the compiler's parsing strategy, especially in nested or templated contexts.

Example of Mutated Content:

Original Pseudo-Code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int data;
    int MyClass::*ptrToMember = &MyClass::data;

    void exampleFunction() {
        int value = this->*ptrToMember;
    }
};
```

Mutated Pseudo-Code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int data;
    int MyClass::*ptrToMember = &MyClass::data;

    void exampleFunction() {
        // Introduce an additional level of indirection
        int value = (*this).*ptrToMember;
    }
};
```

This mutation modifies how the pointer-to-member is accessed, potentially triggering parsing and context resolution issues in the compiler, aligning with known problem areas like nested-name-specifiers and member pointers.
