Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Capture

Target Construct: Lambda Expressions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify lambda expressions that capture variables by reference.
2. Change the capture by reference to capture by value.
3. Ensure the lambda still operates correctly with the captured variables.

Example:
Original Code:
```
void exampleFunction(int &x) {
  [x]() {
    int y = x + 1;
    // Additional operations with x
  };
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
void exampleFunction(int &x) {
  [=]() {
    int y = x + 1;
    // Additional operations with x
  };
}
```

By changing the capture method from reference to value, this mutation tests the compiler's handling of lambda captures, which can potentially expose bugs related to incorrect variable capture management, particularly in complex nested scopes.
