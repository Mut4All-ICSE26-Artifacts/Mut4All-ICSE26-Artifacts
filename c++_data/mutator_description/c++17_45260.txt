Mutation Operator: Deduction Guide Misplacement

Target Construct: Template class with deduction guide

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class declaration in the seed program. For example, if you have "template <typename T> class MyClass;" this is your target construct.
2. Introduce a deduction guide that matches the class template but place it incorrectly or make it syntactically invalid. This involves inserting a deduction guide where it should not logically or syntactically appear.
3. For instance, after the template class declaration, incorrectly place a deduction guide similar to "MyClass() -> MyClass<int>;", but ensure it's syntactically misplaced or malformed to violate valid C++17 grammar.
4. Ensure the deduction guide uses types or template parameters that exist in the seed program. If necessary, declare any new types explicitly before use, ensuring conformance to C++ rules but purposefully misplacing or misforming the guide.
5. Validate that the mutation aligns with the style of the bug report, meaning it might leave the deduction guide incomplete or incorrectly scoped.
