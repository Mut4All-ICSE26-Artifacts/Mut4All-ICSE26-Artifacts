Based on the provided bug report, the C++ compiler has issues related to lambda expressions and template instantiation, particularly when lambda functions are used with templates. The crash appears to involve the capture of variables within these lambda expressions, potentially related to constraints or deduction processes.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Lambda expressions within template functions
Application Context: Inside a template function where a lambda expression is defined and captures external variables.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function within the codebase.
2. Locate a lambda expression within that function. Confirm that the lambda captures at least one external variable.
3. Modify the lambda expression to capture additional variables by reference, including some of which may not be directly used inside the lambda.
4. Example before mutation:
   ```
   template <typename T>
   void exampleFunc(const T& data) {
       auto lambda = [=]() { return data.size(); };
   }
   ```
5. Example after mutation:
   ```
   template <typename T>
   void exampleFunc(const T& data, int extra) {
       auto lambda = [&data, &extra]() { return data.size(); };
   }
   ```

This mutation operator takes advantage of the lambda's capture mechanism by adding complexity to the variable capture pattern, which may expose issues related to variable capture handling in the compiler. The wide applicability of templates and lambdas in modern C++ suggests this mutation has strong universality and high coverage potential.
