Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Return Type with Nested Lambda

Target Code Construct: Lambda Expressions, specifically those nested within another lambda expression's return type declaration.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression within the code that has another lambda expression in its return type declaration using `decltype`.
2. Modify the return type of the inner lambda expression to be dependent on an external or unrelated type or variable, preferably from the enclosing scope or from a template parameter.
3. Ensure the modification makes the return type deduced by `decltype` reliant on a type or variable that causes dependent context evaluation issues.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Find a lambda expression similar to the following pattern:
  ```
  int(*f)(int) = [](auto t) -> decltype([] { return 0; } ()) { return t; };
  ```
- Modify the inner lambda's return type by introducing an external dependency. For example, introduce a template parameter or an externally defined type:
  ```
  template<typename T>
  struct Example {
      static T value;
  };

  // Modify the lambda to use Example<T>::value, where T is a template parameter
  int(*f)(int) = [](auto t) -> decltype([] { return Example<int>::value; } ()) { return t; };
  ```

Explanation:
This mutation targets lambda expressions where an inner lambda expression's return type is deduced using `decltype`. By introducing an external or unrelated dependency in the return type definition, it forces the compiler to deal with potentially dependent contexts, which can lead to assertion failures or crashes if not handled properly. This approach increases the likelihood of triggering compiler bugs related to template instantiations and dependent type evaluations.
