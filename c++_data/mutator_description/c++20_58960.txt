Mutation Operator: Constrained Inner Class Template Mutation

Target: This mutation operator targets class templates, specifically those with constrained inner class templates.

Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a class template with a constrained inner class template. For example:

```cpp
template<typename T> requires SomeConstraint<T>
struct Outer {
    template<typename U> requires AnotherConstraint<U>
    struct Inner {
        // inner class implementation
    };
};
```

Step 2: Mutate the constraints on the inner class template to introduce multiple constraints or alter existing ones to potentially induce unexpected behavior during constraint satisfaction checks.

Example Mutation:
Original Inner Class Template:
```cpp
template<typename U> requires AnotherConstraint<U>
struct Inner {
    // inner class implementation
};
```

Mutated Inner Class Template:
```cpp
template<typename U> requires AnotherConstraint<U> && AdditionalConstraint<U>
struct Inner {
    // inner class implementation
};
```

Step 3: Ensure that the `AdditionalConstraint<U>` is a valid constraint, either existing in the seed program or newly declared in a clear and specific manner. For new constraints, declare them at an appropriate scope in the program:

```cpp
template<typename U>
concept AdditionalConstraint = requires(U u) {
    // constraint expression, e.g., u.someMethod();
};
```

Rationale: By altering the constraints on the inner class template, this mutation operator aims to explore edge cases in constraint satisfaction and template instantiation processes, which are potential triggers for compiler bugs, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple constraints.
