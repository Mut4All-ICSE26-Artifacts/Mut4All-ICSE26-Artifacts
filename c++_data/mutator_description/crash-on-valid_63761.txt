Mutation Operator:

The mutation targets the use of `constexpr` with data structures that involve dynamic memory operations during compile time, which can be complex for the compiler to handle. Specifically, it focuses on operations like `insert`, `emplace`, and `push_back` in `constexpr` contexts with standard containers like `std::vector`.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `constexpr` function where a standard container is modified, e.g., using `insert`, `emplace`, or `push_back`.
2. Replace the container operation with a nested loop structure that attempts to modify the container multiple times in a `constexpr` context. The goal is to simulate conditions that might lead to incorrect memory handling or allocations during constant evaluation.
3. If the container is a vector, ensure that size increments exceed its initial capacity in a `constexpr` context.

Example in pseudo-code:
- Original code:
  ```
  constexpr void modify(std::vector<int>& vec, int value) {
    vec.push_back(value);
  }
  ```

- Mutated code:
  ```
  constexpr void modify(std::vector<int>& vec, int value) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
      vec.push_back(value);
    }
  }
  ```

This mutation operator is expected to increase the likelihood of encountering a crash due to aggressive memory handling in `constexpr` contexts, especially when the container's operations rely heavily on compile-time evaluation of dynamic storage.
