Mutation Operator: Destructor Overload Manipulation

Target Code Construct: Destructor within a class or struct.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct in the seed program that has a user-defined destructor.
2. Replace the user-defined destructor with an implicitly-declared destructor by removing the destructor definition entirely. Ensure the program still compiles by handling dependencies that require explicit destructor behavior.
3. Trigger the need for overload resolution by introducing a base class with a virtual destructor if a base class does not already exist. Add the following base class declaration if necessary:
   ```
   class Base {
   public:
       virtual ~Base() {}
   };
   ```
   Ensure the class being mutated inherits from this base class:
   ```
   class TargetClass : public Base {
       // Original members of TargetClass
   };
   ```
4. If the class already has a base class, ensure that the base class destructor is declared as virtual, prompting the need for overload resolution in derived destructors.

This mutation is likely to cause the compiler to evaluate the destructor in contexts that may lead to internal inconsistencies, particularly in managing special member function properties.
