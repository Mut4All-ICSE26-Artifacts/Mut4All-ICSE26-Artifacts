Mutation Operator: Unclosed Class Definition

Target: Class Definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a class definition within the seed program that includes a complete set of member declarations and a closing brace followed by a semicolon.
2. Remove the closing brace '}' of the class definition, effectively leaving the class body open.
3. Ensure there is a subsequent token, such as a semicolon or another declaration, directly following the class definition.

Example before mutation:
```
class ExampleClass {
public:
    int memberFunction() { return 0; }
};
int someFunction() { return 1; }
```

Example after mutation:
```
class ExampleClass {
public:
    int memberFunction() { return 0; }
// Note: The closing brace '}' intentionally removed
int someFunction() { return 1; }
```

This mutation operator targets the class definition's structural integrity and can potentially trigger a compiler crash due to the unexpected parsing state caused by the lack of a proper class closure.
