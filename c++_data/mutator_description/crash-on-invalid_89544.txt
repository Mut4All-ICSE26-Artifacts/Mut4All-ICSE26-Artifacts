Mutation Operator:

Target Code Construct: Destructor within a Class Definition

Mutation Rule: Modify the destructor of an existing class in a C++ program to use an incorrect syntax that resembles the erroneous example given in the bug report.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. Identify a class in the C++ seed program that contains a destructor. If no destructor is explicitly defined, consider using the default destructor.

2. Modify the destructor definition by introducing a malformed pure-specifier-like syntax, similar to the example from the bug report. Specifically, change the destructor to include an invalid assignment operation within its definition.

3. The mutation should change the destructor declaration from a valid syntax to an erroneous one as follows:
   - Change from:
     ```cpp
     ~ClassName() { /* valid destructor implementation */ }
     ```
   - To:
     ```cpp
     ~ClassName() = {}  // Invalid destructor syntax
     ```

4. Ensure that the class being mutated is used in conjunction with C++ type traits or similar constructs that may trigger specific compiler behavior, as seen in the bug report.

Example:
Given a class `Widget` in the seed program:

Before Mutation:
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
    ~Widget() { /* valid destructor code */ }
};
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
class Widget {
public:
    ~Widget() = {}  // Intentionally malformed destructor
};
```

Note: This mutation operator is designed to potentially trigger compiler bugs related to destructor parsing errors and interactions with type trait evaluations, similar to the provided bug scenario. Use this mutation with care, as it is intended to expose and test compiler robustness against erroneous destructor syntax.
