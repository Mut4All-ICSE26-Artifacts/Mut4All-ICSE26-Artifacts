Mutation Operator:

Target: Variable Templates with Constraints

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a variable template declaration that includes a constraint, such as:
   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   requires(SomeConstraint<T>)
   constexpr T variable_template = /* some expression */;
   ```

2. Modify the constraint in the `requires` clause to use an unconstrained concept or to introduce a recursive or conflicting constraint. For example:
   - Change `requires(SomeConstraint<T>)` to `requires(UnrelatedConcept<T>)` where `UnrelatedConcept` is a concept that does not depend on `T` or is irrelevant to the template's intended usage.
   - Alternatively, introduce a self-referential constraint such as `requires(SameConcept<T> && !SameConcept<T>)` where `SameConcept` is the original concept being applied.

3. Ensure that the modified constraint is syntactically valid but semantically incorrect or causes logical inconsistencies.

Example:
Original:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept ConvertibleToInt = std::is_convertible_v<T, int>;

template <typename T>
requires(ConvertibleToInt<T>)
constexpr T example = 42;
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template <typename T>
concept AlwaysFalse = false;

template <typename T>
requires(AlwaysFalse<T>)
constexpr T example = 42;
```

This mutation is designed to explore how the compiler handles semantically incorrect or logically conflicting constraints on variable templates, potentially triggering deeper analysis paths that lead to a crash or unexpected behavior.
