Mutation Operator: Struct Attribute Removal

Target: The mutation operator targets struct definitions within C++ programs, specifically focusing on attributes applied to these structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition within the C++ code. For instance:
   ```
   struct MyStruct [[deprecated]] {
       int member;
   };
   ```
2. Remove any attributes associated with the struct. In this example, remove the `[[deprecated]]` attribute.
3. Ensure that the struct remains syntactically valid after the attribute removal. The modified code should look like this:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
       int member;
   };
   ```
4. Check for any dependent code that relies on the removed attribute and ensure that it remains functional or note any necessary adjustments.

This mutation operator leverages the use of attributes in struct definitions and modifies them to explore potential compiler crash scenarios triggered by the absence of such attributes. This operator is likely to have wide applicability given the common usage of attributes in struct declarations.
