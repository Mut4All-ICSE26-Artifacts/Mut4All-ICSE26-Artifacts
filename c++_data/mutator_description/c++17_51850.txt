Mutation Operator: Template Argument Value Mutation in Templated Lambdas

This mutation operator specifically targets templated lambda expressions, commonly found in C++17 and later. The mutation aims to exploit the way template arguments are handled within lambda functions, which can lead to unexpected behavior or compiler crashes.

Target Code Construct:
This mutation applies to lambda expressions, specifically those that are templated with parameters.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a templated lambda expression within the program. Ensure it has a template parameter list (e.g., [&]<int f>(int z)).

2. Within the lambda expression, locate an instance where the lambda's `operator()` is invoked with a template argument (e.g., test_lambda_impl2.operator()<f, 0>();).

3. Mutate the template argument(s) by introducing an additional layer of expression or computation rather than passing the template parameter directly. For example, if the parameter is `<f, 0>`, consider changing it to `<f + 1, 0>`, or `<f, 0 + 1>` to introduce subtle computational changes.

4. Ensure that during mutation, the changes are syntactically correct and do not create undeclared variables or types. The operations can include mathematical operations (addition, subtraction), bitwise operations, or type casting when applicable.

5. Apply the mutation in a way that affects all relevant instances within the lambda to ensure consistency in behavior across the codebase.

Example Mutation (Pseudo-Code):
Original:
```cpp
auto test_lambda_impl1 = [&]<int f>(int z)
{
    switch(z)
    {
        case 0:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<f, 0>();
            break;
        case 1:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<f, 1>();
            break;
        case 2:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<f, 2>();
            break;
    }
};
```

Mutated:
```cpp
auto test_lambda_impl1 = [&]<int f>(int z)
{
    switch(z)
    {
        case 0:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<(f + 1), 0>();  // Mutated template argument
            break;
        case 1:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<f, (1 + 1)>();  // Mutated template argument
            break;
        case 2:
            test_lambda_impl2.operator()<(f - 1), 2>();  // Mutated template argument
            break;
    }
};
```

By modifying the template arguments in this manner, the mutation leverages potential weaknesses in the compiler's handling of template expressions, especially when calculations or different expressions are introduced as template arguments, possibly causing the compiler to crash or behave unexpectedly.
