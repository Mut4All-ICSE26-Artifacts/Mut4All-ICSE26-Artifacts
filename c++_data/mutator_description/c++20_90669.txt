Mutation Operator: Modify Template Function Instantiation

Target Construct: Template Function Instantiation within function templates

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template in the codebase, preferably one that involves complex parameterization like multiple type parameters or nested templates.
2. Within this function template, locate a call to a template function that uses `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`.
3. Modify the instantiation of the template function call by adding an additional layer of template parameters. This could involve adding an extra dummy template parameter that defaults to a known type like `int`.
4. Ensure the instantiation still makes logical sense by adjusting calls or parameters as needed to match the new template signature.
5. Example in pseudo-code:
   - Original Code: `auto ptr = make_unique<Type1, Type2>(arg1, arg2);`
   - Mutated Code: `auto ptr = make_unique<Type1, Type2, int>(arg1, arg2);`
   
This mutation operator exploits the complexity of template instantiation, particularly around smart pointers and nested templates, which are common triggers for compiler crashes as they push the template instantiation logic. By modifying the template parameters, we force the compiler to re-evaluate its instantiation logic, potentially exposing latent bugs.
