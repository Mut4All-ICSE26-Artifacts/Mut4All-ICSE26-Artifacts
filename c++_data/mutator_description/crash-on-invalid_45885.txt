Mutation Operator: Modify Function Calls with Macros

Target: This mutation operator targets function calls where macros are used to define function-like behaviors.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function call within the code. Ensure that the function has a valid prototype, and the call is correctly formed.
2. Replace the function call with a macro that mimics a function-like behavior but introduces a potential inconsistency.
3. Define this macro at the top of the file or in the same scope where the function call exists.
4. The macro should mimic the function call by using `#define` and should include a reference to a file identifier or token that might not align with the function's original context or scope.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
void exampleFunction(int a, int b) {
    // Some operation
}

int main() {
    exampleFunction(1, 2);
    return 0;
}
```

Mutation:
1. Define a macro at the start of the file:
   ```cpp
   #define EXAMPLE_MACRO(x, y) (x + y) // Simulate a similar operation to the original function
   ```

2. Replace the function call with the macro:
   ```cpp
   int main() {
       EXAMPLE_MACRO(1, 2); // Replaces exampleFunction with EXAMPLE_MACRO
       return 0;
   }
   ```

3. Ensure the macro introduces a file identifier inconsistency. For instance, access a token that wasn't originally part of the function's context:
   ```cpp
   #define EXAMPLE_MACRO(x, y) (x + y + __LINE__) // Using __LINE__ might cause an inconsistency
   ```

This mutation operator leverages macros to introduce subtle inconsistencies in file identifiers or line numbers, which are more likely to trigger assertion failures or inconsistencies in the compiler's diagnostic rendering phase.
