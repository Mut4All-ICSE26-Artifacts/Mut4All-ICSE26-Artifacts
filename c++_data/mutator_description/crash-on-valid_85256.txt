Mutation Operator

Target Code Construct: Base Class Initializer Order in Derived Class Constructors

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class `Derived` that inherits from multiple base classes `Base1`, `Base2`, ..., `BaseN`.
2. Locate the constructor definition of the `Derived` class.
3. In the initializer list of the `Derived` constructor, modify the order in which the base class constructors are called. For instance, if the original order is `Base1()`, `Base2()`, ..., `BaseN()`, change it to a non-linear order such as `Base2()`, `Base1()`, ..., `BaseN()`.
4. Ensure that the initializer list still initializes all base classes to maintain syntactic correctness.

Example:

Original Constructor:
```cpp
class Base1 {};
class Base2 {};
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    Derived() : Base1(), Base2() {}
};
```

Mutated Constructor:
```cpp
class Base1 {};
class Base2 {};
class Derived : public Base1, public Base2 {
public:
    Derived() : Base2(), Base1() {}
};
```

By altering the order of base class initializers in the constructor of `Derived`, we can induce scenarios that might trigger assertion failures or unexpected behavior in the compiler's handling of constructor calls.
