Mutation Operator: List Initialization in Template Function

Target: Template function definition in classes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function within a class that uses auto type deduction through a decltype expression or similar mechanism.
2. Locate a decltype statement where a function returning a reference to a template class is used.
3. Replace the decltype expression with a direct list initialization of an object of the inferred type.
4. Ensure the replacement involves a non-initialized list, which could be empty or having inappropriate elements for the type.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Locate a template function within a class. For example, in the given code, locate the function `void S::f()`.
2. Identify the use of decltype within the function, such as `decltype(g())`.
3. Replace the declaration using decltype with a list initialization. If `decltype(g())` returns `const Vector<int>&`, replace it with `auto _ = const Vector<int>& {}`.
4. Ensure the list initialization expression is empty or has mismatched element types.

Example of Mutated Content:
Original:
```cpp
template <class Dummy>
void S::f() {
  __attribute__((unused)) auto _ =
    decltype(g()){};
}
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template <class Dummy>
void S::f() {
  __attribute__((unused)) auto _ = const Vector<int>& {};
}
```

This mutation targets the list initialization structure often used in template functions, which is more likely to trigger compiler bugs related to the handling of template types and initialization semantics.
