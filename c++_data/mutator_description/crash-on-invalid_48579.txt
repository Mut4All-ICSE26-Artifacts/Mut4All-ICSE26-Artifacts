Mutation Operator: Alter Struct Declaration with Incomplete Type Usage

Target: Struct declaration and usage within the function body.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a struct definition within the source code. For example:

   ```cpp
   struct MyStruct {
       int member;
   };
   ```

2. Identify a function within the code, ideally one using or interacting with the struct. For example:

   ```cpp
   void exampleFunction() {
       // Some logic here
   }
   ```

3. Modify the function body to reference an incomplete or undefined type of the struct. This can be achieved by declaring a pointer to a struct type which is not fully defined within the scope of the function. For instance:

   ```cpp
   void exampleFunction() {
       struct MyStruct* ptr;
       // Any operation on 'ptr' without a proper definition in scope
       ptr->member = 0;
   }
   ```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the handling of incomplete types by directly referencing an undefined or incomplete struct type within a function. By doing so, the mutation exploits areas where the compiler may not correctly handle incomplete types in expressions or operations, potentially leading to crashes. This can surface deeply rooted assumptions in the compiler's handling of the language's structural and type completeness rules.
