Mutation Operator: Anonymous Struct Usage with Alias Template

Target: This mutation targets the use of anonymous structs in conjunction with alias templates within a code block.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any instance of an alias template that is declared but not used within an anonymous struct. For this operator, focus on alias templates that could cause confusion in type deduction or alias usage.
2. Introduce an anonymous struct within a code block, and attempt to utilize the alias template for a member within the struct without properly specifying a type.
3. Specifically, use a placeholder for a member variable within the anonymous struct intended to use the alias template but omit the necessary type information.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a suitable function or code block where an anonymous struct can be sensibly introduced.
- Introduce an anonymous struct within this block. For example:
  ```
  {
      struct {
          // Potential erroneous usage of alias template
          AliasTemplateName memberVariable;
      };
  }
  ```
- Replace `AliasTemplateName` with the alias template you wish to test. Ensure the alias template requires a type parameter.
- Do not provide the type for the alias template when using it as a member within the anonymous struct. This is intended to simulate a misuse that triggers a crash.

Example:
- Suppose you have an alias template defined as:
  ```
  template <typename T> using Alias = T;
  ```
- Apply the mutation:
  ```
  {
      struct {
          Alias anonymousMember; // Intentionally omit the type T
      };
  }
  ```

Expected Outcome:
This mutation is intended to trigger improper type deduction or cause confusion within the compiler's type information retrieval, potentially leading to a crash or invalid behavior. The mutation tests the robustness of how the compiler handles alias templates within anonymous structs, especially when type information is incomplete or omitted.
