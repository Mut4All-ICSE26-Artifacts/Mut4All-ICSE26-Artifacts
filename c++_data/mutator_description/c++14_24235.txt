Mutation Operator: Constexpr Evaluation Manipulation

Target Code Construct: Constexpr variables and functions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `constexpr` variable or function in the code.

2. For a `constexpr` function:
   a. Replace its implementation with a recursive call that has a termination based on a condition difficult to be resolved at compile-time. For instance, use a conditional statement that involves a non-trivial arithmetic operation or bitwise operation.

   Example:
   Original:
   ```
   constexpr int factorial(int n) {
       return (n <= 1) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1));
   }
   ```

   Mutated:
   ```
   constexpr int factorial(int n) {
       return (n == 0) ? 1 : (n * factorial(n - 1 + (n % 2)));
   }
   ```

3. For a `constexpr` variable:
   a. Replace the initializer with an expression that involves a non-trivial arithmetic operation or cast that might be evaluated at runtime instead of compile-time.

   Example:
   Original:
   ```
   constexpr int value = 5 + 3;
   ```

   Mutated:
   ```
   constexpr int value = (5 << 1) + (8 / 2) - (3 & 1);
   ```

4. Ensure that the mutated `constexpr` still conforms to the `constexpr` requirements to trigger the evaluation logic in the compiler.

This mutation operator aims to exploit edge cases in the constexpr evaluation logic of a C++ compiler, potentially causing crashes due to complex or unexpected evaluation paths.
