Mutation Operator: Modify Template Parameters in Partial Specialization

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets templates, specifically focusing on partial specialization of template classes or functions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template structure within the code, focusing on those that utilize template template parameters, as these are prone to compiler bugs.
2. Alter the conditions for a partial specialization:
   a. Choose a partial specialization that is already defined using a template template parameter.
   b. Introduce an additional constraint or modify an existing one in the template template parameter list.
3. Specifically, change the number of template parameters in the specialization to contradict or overlap with its primary template declaration.

Example Mutation Process:
1. Locate the primary template definition:
   ```
   template <typename... param_types>
   struct is_specified_instantiation_of {
     template <typename T, template <param_types...> class container>
     struct val {
       static constexpr bool value = false;
     };
   };
   ```

2. Identify a partial specialization:
   ```
   template <template <param_types...> class container, param_types... params>
   struct val<container<params...>, container> {
     static constexpr bool value = true;
   };
   ```

3. Perform mutation by altering the parameters in the partial specialization:
   - Modify the number of parameters in the specialization:
     ```
     template <template <param_types...> class container, typename U, param_types... params>
     struct val<container<U, params...>, container> {
       static constexpr bool value = true;
     };
     ```
   - This change introduces an additional type parameter `U` to the specialization, which may lead to contradictions or misalignments with the primary template declaration, potentially causing a compiler crash due to parsing issues.

This mutation operator is designed to stress-test the compiler's handling of complex template specializations, which are known to be a frequent source of bugs in C++ compilers. It targets the specific conditions that can lead to inconsistencies in template specialization logic.
