Mutation Operator: Unmatched Control Flow Labels

Target Code Construct: Labeled statements and `goto` constructs within functions.

Mutation Rule: Introduce or modify control flow labels and `goto` statements to create situations where the `goto` statement jumps over variable declarations with non-trivial destructors.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Identify a function within the codebase that contains at least one variable with a non-trivial destructor (e.g., an object of a class with a custom destructor).

2. Inside the function, insert a label using the syntax `LABEL_NAME:` before the point where the variable with a non-trivial destructor is declared. Ensure that the label is distinct and does not conflict with existing labels or keywords.

3. Insert a `goto` statement before this label in such a way that it causes the label to be skipped, leading to a jump over the variable declaration.

4. Ensure the jump is such that it would bypass variable initialization or declaration, mimicking potentially invalid control flow.

5. If necessary, resolve any syntax errors by introducing appropriate braces or scope delimiters to maintain valid syntax while preserving the possibility of creating a crashing scenario.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
int sampleFunction() {
    int x = 0;
    std::string s = "example";
    // other code
    return x;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
int sampleFunction() {
    int x = 0;
    goto SKIP_INIT;  // Introducing a goto statement

    std::string s = "example";  // This variable has a non-trivial destructor

    SKIP_INIT:  // Introducing a label to be skipped over
    // other code
    return x;
}
```

Note: The mutation leverages existing variables and control constructs, focusing on creating a situation that can potentially trigger internal compiler errors by altering control flow in a manner that is valid but unusual or unsupported.
