Mutation Operator: Enum Type Casting in Switch Statements

Target: Switch statements within templated or non-templated class constructors that involve enum types.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a switch statement that uses an enum type, either directly or through an object of a templated class, as the controlling expression within the constructor of a class.
2. Modify the controlling expression of the switch to perform an explicit type cast using a static_cast to the enum type if it is not already cast. If it is already cast, remove the cast.
3. Ensure the enum type exists in the seed program by checking for existing enum declarations. If not present, introduce a basic enum declaration at the start of the program or within an appropriate scope before the switch statement. For instance, declare `enum ExampleEnum { Value1 };` if no enums are available.
4. If the switch statement is within a templated class, ensure the template type parameter is not directly related to the enum being cast.

Example of Mutation:
Original Code:
```
struct Example {
    Example() {
        switch (enumVariable) {
            case EnumValue:
                break;
        }
    }
    EnumType enumVariable;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Example {
    Example() {
        switch (static_cast<EnumType>(enumVariable)) {
            case EnumValue:
                break;
        }
    }
    EnumType enumVariable;
};
```

In this mutation, the controlling expression of the switch statement is modified by adding an explicit static_cast to the enum type, which may trigger compiler behavior differences.
