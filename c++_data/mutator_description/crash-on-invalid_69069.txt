Mutation Operator: Modify Const and Volatile Qualifiers in OpenMP Directives

Target: This mutation operator targets variable declarations within OpenMP atomic capture directives, specifically focusing on const and volatile qualifiers.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any variable within the OpenMP atomic capture directive that is qualified with const or volatile. These qualifiers can cause compliance issues with OpenMP's expected usage and may lead to compiler assertions or crashes.

2. If a variable is declared as const (e.g., const int x;), remove the const qualifier from the declaration. If the variable is declared as volatile, remove the volatile qualifier in the same manner.

3. Ensure that the OpenMP directive's operation remains syntactically correct after the removal of the qualifier.

Example:
Consider the following seed code:

```
int main() {
  int v;
  const int x;
  #pragma omp atomic capture
  {
    v = x;
    x = 1;  // Error due to const qualifier
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Apply the mutation:

1. Identify the const qualifier in the declaration of x.

2. Remove the const qualifier:

```
int main() {
  int v;
  int x;  // const removed
  #pragma omp atomic capture
  {
    v = x;
    x = 1;
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Rationale:
This mutation is likely to trigger compiler issues because removing const or volatile qualifiers can affect the expected behavior of variables within concurrent and parallelized sections of code. The mutation targets the interaction between variable qualifiers and OpenMP directives, which is prone to causing unexpected compiler behavior, especially in edge cases where qualifiers are removed from immutable or special-purpose variables. By focusing on qualifiers, this mutation has strong universality and can be applied to various constructs across different seed programs, providing high coverage for potential compiler bugs related to OpenMP usage.
