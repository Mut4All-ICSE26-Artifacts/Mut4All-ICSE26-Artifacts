Mutation Operator: Alter Return Type in Function Within Struct

Target Construct: The mutation operator targets a function within a struct, specifically focusing on altering its return type.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct in the code that contains a function with a return type.
2. Change the return type of the function to a different type that is incompatible with the operations being performed within the function. For example, if the function returns an integer, change it to return a pointer or a reference type.
3. Ensure that the return statement within the function matches the newly specified return type, even if it leads to semantic errors.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct B {
    int b() { return 42; }
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct B {
    int* b() { return 42; } // Change return type from int to int* and return statement accordingly
};
```

This mutation operator is designed to expose weaknesses in the compiler's ability to handle inconsistent return types within struct functions, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior. By specifically altering the return type, the mutation targets the compiler's type checking and error handling mechanisms, which are critical areas that can lead to crashes when not handled correctly.
