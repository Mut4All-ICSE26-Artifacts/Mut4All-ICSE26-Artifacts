Based on the provided bug report, the crash is associated with the usage of templates and the interaction with nested name specifiers. Specifically, the crash occurs in the function `k` where template nesting and member access within a decltype specifier are utilized. The following mutation operator is designed to exploit these constructs, potentially uncovering similar bugs:

Mutation Operator: Nested Template Member Access Mutation

Target Code Construct: Template Functions with Nested Name Specifiers

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function (or member function within a templated class/struct) in the seed program.
2. Within the function, locate a member access expression involving a template class with nested templates or name specifiers.
3. Modify the member access to introduce additional layers of template nesting and member resolution. Specifically:
   a. If the original expression is of the form `t.U::template B<V>::MEM`, transform it to add an additional template layer, such as `t.U::template B<V>::template C<W>::MEM`.
   b. Ensure `C` is a valid template class within the scope, or modify an existing class to be a template if necessary.
4. Introduce code to declare and define the additional template class `C` within the appropriate scope. This class should:
   a. Be a template class with a single type parameter, such as `template <class W> struct C`.
   b. Include a member definition or alias that facilitates the additional member access.
5. Ensure that the types and qualifiers are used consistently with the existing program constructs to avoid syntax errors unrelated to the intended mutation.

Example (Pseudo-code):
Original Code:
```cpp
template <class T>
struct A {
  template <class V>
  struct B {
    int MEM;
  };
};

template <class T, class U, class V>
auto k(T t, U u, V v) -> decltype(t.U::template B<V>::MEM) {}

int main() {
  A<int>::B<D> obj;
  k(obj, A<int>(), D());
}
```

Mutated Code:
1. Introduce a new template class within `A`:
```cpp
template <class T>
struct A {
  template <class V>
  struct B {
    template <class W>
    struct C {
      int MEM;
    };
  };
};
```

2. Modify the function `k` to use the new nested template:
```cpp
template <class T, class U, class V>
auto k(T t, U u, V v) -> decltype(t.U::template B<V>::template C<V>::MEM) {}
```

This mutation operator extends the depth of template nesting and member access, leveraging potential areas of instability in compiler handling of complex template hierarchies.
