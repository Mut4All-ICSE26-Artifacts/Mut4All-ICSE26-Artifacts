Based on the provided bug report, it seems that the issue is related to template constraints and lambda functions using C++20 concepts. The compiler erroneously accepts code where the constraints on the lambda's parameters are not satisfied, leading to a potential crash.

Mutation Operator: Template Constraint Violation in Lambda

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets lambda expressions that are returned from template functions using C++20 concepts.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function that returns a lambda expression. Ensure the lambda uses a concept to constrain its parameters.
2. Introduce a call to this lambda where the argument types violate the constraints specified by the concept.
3. Ensure that the argument types used in the call are such that they do not satisfy the `std::same_as` concept with the original types.

Example:
Suppose the seed program has the following function:

```cpp
#include <concepts>

template <typename T>
auto myFunc(T value) {
  return [](std::same_as<T> auto arg) {
    // Some code
  };
}

int main() {
  myFunc(10); // Original correct call
}
```

Apply the mutation by modifying the call in `main`:

1. Change the lambda call to pass an argument of a different type:
   - Original: `myFunc(10)(10);`
   - Mutated: `myFunc(10)(10u);` // Pass an unsigned int to violate std::same_as<T> constraint

By violating the constraints in this way, the mutation operator explores scenarios where the compiler behavior might be incorrect or lead to crashes due to mismanaged constraints. This specific mutation is likely to trigger bugs related to incorrect constraint handling in compilers supporting C++20 concepts.
