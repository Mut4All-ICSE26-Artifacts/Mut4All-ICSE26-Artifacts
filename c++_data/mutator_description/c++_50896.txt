Mutation Operator: Enum Typedef with Incomplete Type

Target Construct: Enum Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing enum declaration in the seed program. If none exists, introduce an enum declaration with at least one enumerator.

2. Before the enum declaration, introduce a typedef for an incomplete type. For example, declare a typedef for a struct that is not yet defined. 

3. Modify one of the enumerators to be of this typedef type. This simulates a misuse of an incomplete type within an enum.

4. Ensure the incomplete type remains undefined in the scope of the compilation unit to maintain its incomplete status.

Example:
```
struct UndefinedType; // Step 2: Introduce a typedef for an incomplete type
typedef struct UndefinedType IncompleteAlias;

enum ExampleEnum { // Step 1: Identify or introduce an enum declaration
    VALUE1, 
    VALUE2 = sizeof(IncompleteAlias) // Step 3: Use the incomplete typedef in an invalid context within the enum
};

// Step 4: Ensure 'UndefinedType' remains undefined
```

This mutation is aimed at exploiting faulty handling of incomplete types within enum declarations, potentially triggering issues related to type completeness checks.
