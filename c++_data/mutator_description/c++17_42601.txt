Mutation Operator: Function Body Mismanagement

Target: Function declarations and definitions.

Mutation Rule: This operator focuses on altering the structure of function bodies with compound statements. Specifically, it introduces an empty compound statement or rearranges existing code within a function body to increase the chance of triggering parsing issues that could lead to a compiler crash.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify a function definition within the codebase. Ensure it contains a compound statement (enclosed in braces `{}`).
2. Within the identified function, introduce an empty compound statement. This can be done by inserting a pair of braces `{}` randomly placed within the function body.
3. Alternatively, rearrange the existing code by isolating a block of code into its own compound statement. For example, wrap a few lines of code in additional braces.
4. Ensure all other parts of the code remain unchanged, and no undeclared variables or types are introduced.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int x = 10;
    if (x > 5) {
        x += 5;
    }
    // Remaining code
}
```

After Mutation:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int x = 10;
    {}
    if (x > 5) {
        { x += 5; }
    }
    // Remaining code
}
```

This mutation does not introduce new variables or types. It works with the existing structure, potentially increasing the likelihood of encountering parsing issues in the compiler when handling compound statements, thus potentially triggering a crash.
