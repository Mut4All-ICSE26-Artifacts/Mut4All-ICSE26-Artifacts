Mutation Operator: Function Call Argument Mutation

Target Code Construct: Function Call

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function call in the code, preferably within the main function or any compound statement.
2. Locate the argument list of the function call.
3. Modify one of the existing arguments by introducing an operation that can lead to an error in evaluation.
   - For instance, if the argument is a variable or a simple expression, replace it with an expression that involves division by zero or a null pointer dereference.
4. Ensure that the modified argument remains syntactically correct to avoid syntax errors but semantically incorrect to induce a possible crash or assertion in the compiler.

Example:
Original Code:
```
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    func(x, 20);
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    func(x / 0, 20); // Introducing division by zero to the argument
}
```

In this mutation, the operator introduces a division by zero in the argument list of the function call, which can cause the compiler to hit error-handling paths, potentially exposing bugs like the one described in the bug report.
