Mutation Operator: Modify Template and Class/Struct Interaction

Target: This mutation operator targets template classes or structs, particularly those that involve nested types or classes, such as iterators or traits within a template class.

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify a template class or struct that involves a nested class or type definition. For example, a class `TemplateClass` with a nested class `NestedType`.

2. Inside the template class, modify the definition of the nested class or type to introduce a dependent name that is not fully resolved. This can be done by referencing a type or member that relies on a template parameter, but without proper specification or instantiation. 

3. Specifically, change a member function or typedef within the nested class to use a dependent name without providing full context. For instance, use a template parameter as a type or a base class for inheritance without explicit instantiation.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class TemplateClass {
public:
    class NestedType {
    public:
        void func() {
            // Some implementation
        }
    };
};
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
template <typename T>
class TemplateClass {
public:
    class NestedType {
    public:
        using BaseType = typename T::NotYetInstantiated;
        
        void func() {
            BaseType();
        }
    };
};
```

Explanation:
In the mutated code, `BaseType` is defined using a dependent type `typename T::NotYetInstantiated`. This introduces a situation where the compiler must handle a dependent name, potentially triggering assertion failures or crashes if not managed correctly.

Note:
Care must be taken to introduce modifications that lead to compilation issues without relying on new or custom types, ensuring applicability across various seed programs.
