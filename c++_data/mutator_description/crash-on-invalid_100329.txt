Mutation Operator:
Focus: Function Definitions with Defaulted Operators

Target Code Construct: Function definitions utilizing defaulted operators, specifically within classes or structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class or struct definition in the seed program containing operator overloading.
2. Select an overloaded operator function within this class or struct.
3. Modify the operator function to use a 'default' keyword for its definition, but introduce an incorrect parameter type usage similar to the bug report. Specifically, use 'this' with an explicit parameter type that is incorrect.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a class or struct containing an operator overload:
  Example: 
  ```
  struct B {
      bool operator==(const B&) const;
  };
  ```
- Modify the operator function to include a 'default' keyword but incorrectly use explicit parameter types:
  Change:
  ```
  bool B::operator==(const B&) const { return true; }
  ```
  To:
  ```
  bool B::operator==(this const int&, const B&) = default;
  ```

Explanation:
This mutation targets the misuse of the 'this' keyword with incorrect explicit parameter types in operator overloads, which is similar to the issue leading to the compiler crash in the bug report. This mutation exploits incorrect syntax and defaulting that are likely to trigger issues in the compiler's handling of defaulted operators.
