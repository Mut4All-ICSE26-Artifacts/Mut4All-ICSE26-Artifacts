Mutation Operator: Modify Binary Operator in Conditional Expressions

1. **Target Code Construct**: Conditional expressions within constexpr functions.
2. **Mutation Rule**:
   - Identify a conditional expression within a constexpr function where a non-standard compound statement is used.
   - Locate binary operators within the conditional expression.
   - Modify these binary operators to use incompatible types that can trigger issues with type handling.
   - Ensure the modification preserves the syntactic validity but challenges type compatibility checks.

3. **Step-by-Step Instructions**:
   - In a constexpr function, find conditional statements such as `if`, `while`, or `for`.
   - Within these statements, locate binary operations that involve integral or enumeration types on both sides.
   - Change one side of the binary operation to an expression that evaluates to a type incompatible with integral or enumeration types, such as a pointer type or a custom class object with no conversion to integral types.
   - For example, if the original code is `if (a < b)`, mutate it to `if (a < &b)` where `b` is a variable of integral type, turning one operand into a pointer.

4. **Example**:
   - Original Code Snippet:
     ```cpp
     constexpr int example() {
       int a = 0, b = 1;
       if (a < b) return 2;
       return 1;
     }
     ```
   - Mutated Code Snippet:
     ```cpp
     constexpr int example() {
       int a = 0, b = 1;
       if (a < &b) return 2; // Here, `&b` introduces an incompatible operand type.
       return 1;
     }
     ```

This operator primarily targets the type-checking mechanisms within conditional statements, pushing the compiler to handle unexpected operand types, potentially causing assertion failures as seen in the provided bug report.
