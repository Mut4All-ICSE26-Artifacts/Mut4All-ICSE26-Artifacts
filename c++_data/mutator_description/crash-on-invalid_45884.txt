Mutation Operator: Modify Anonymous Namespace Usage

Target Code Construct: Anonymous namespaces and their associated declarations.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify anonymous namespace declarations within the code. These typically look like "namespace {" without a namespace name.
2. Convert the anonymous namespace into a named inline namespace. Choose a unique name that doesn't conflict with existing names in the seed program.
3. Ensure that any classes, functions, or variables within the anonymous namespace are correctly referenced with the new namespace name if used outside the namespace.

Example Steps:
- Original Code:
  ```cpp
  namespace {
      class A {
          // class implementation
      };
  }
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```cpp
  inline namespace UniqueName {
      class A {
          // class implementation
      };
  }
  ```

Explanation:
By assigning a unique name to the previously anonymous namespace and marking it as inline, we ensure that the entities declared within can be directly accessed without specifying the namespace name unless explicitly needed. This transformation tests the compiler's handling of namespace-related constructs and their integration with class and member declarations.
