Mutation Operator: Modify Function Overloads with Constraints

Target Construct: Member functions within templated structs or classes that have overloaded versions, some of which use constraints (e.g., concepts).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a member function within a templated struct or class that has multiple overloaded versions, where at least one version includes constraints using concepts.
2. Introduce a new overload of this member function without any constraints. This overload should have a distinct signature or parameter list compared to existing overloads.
3. Ensure the new overload has a unique parameter type or a combination of parameters that does not currently exist in the other overloads.

Example:
Consider the following templated struct with constrained member function overloads:

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = __is_class(T);

template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f() { }
    void f() requires C<T> { }
};
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Introduce a new overload of `f` without constraints:
   - Add a new overload that takes a parameter of a different type that doesn't conflict with existing overloads.

```cpp
template<typename T>
struct S {
    void f() { }                           // Existing overload
    void f() requires C<T> { }             // Existing constrained overload
    void f(int) { }                        // New overload with a unique parameter
};
```

By adding an overload that is not subject to any constraints, this modification tests how the compiler manages overload resolution and template instantiation involving unconstrained versions coexisting with constrained ones.
