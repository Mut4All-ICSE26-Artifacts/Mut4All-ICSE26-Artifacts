Mutation Operator: Modify `[[no_unique_address]]` Attribute

Target Code Construct: Struct Member Variable in C++ Structs

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a C++ struct where a member variable is decorated with the `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute.
2. Remove the `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute from the member variable.
3. Alternatively, add the `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute to a different member variable within the same struct that currently does not have it.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Empty {};
struct Foo {
  [[no_unique_address]] Empty m_empty;
  long m_a;
  long m_b;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Empty {};
struct Foo {
  Empty m_empty; // Removed [[no_unique_address]] attribute
  long m_a;
  [[no_unique_address]] long m_b; // Added attribute to a different member
};
```

This mutation operator targets the use of the `[[no_unique_address]]` attribute within C++ structs, a feature that can lead to compiler crashes due to unexpected interactions with memory layout optimizations. By altering the presence of this attribute, we can test the robustness of the compiler's handling of such optimizations.
