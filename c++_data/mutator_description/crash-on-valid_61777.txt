Mutation Operator: Modify Template Parameter with Constraints

Target Code Construct:
The mutation operator targets class templates with constrained non-type template parameters (NTTP) nested within a class template.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a class template that contains a nested class template with constrained NTTP.
2. Identify the constrained NTTP within the nested class template declaration.
3. Change the constraint on the NTTP to a different constraint or remove it altogether.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Identify the constrained NTTP in the nested class template. For example, in the template declaration `template <class, C auto> struct A { ... };`, the constrained NTTP is `C auto`.
- Modify the constraint `C` to another concept or remove it to become a regular NTTP without constraints.
- If using another concept, ensure that the new concept is defined in the program or replace it with a trivially true constraint such as `true`, or completely remove it to become `template <class, auto>`.

Example Pseudo-code:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
template <class> concept C = true;

template <class> struct O {
  template <class, C auto> struct A { static const int i = 0; };
};
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
template <class> struct O {
  template <class, auto> struct A { static const int i = 0; };
};
```

This mutation disrupts the original constraints, potentially triggering bugs related to constraint evaluation in the compiler, especially if it relies on the concept for type checking or evaluation.
