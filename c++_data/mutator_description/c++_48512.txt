Mutation Operator: Function Attribute Removal

Target Code Construct: Function Definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify functions within the C++ code that have attributes specified. These attributes are typically specified between double square brackets ([[ ]]) before the function’s return type or right after the function name in parentheses.
2. Remove all attributes associated with the function. This means deleting the entire attribute specification, including the double square brackets and any text enclosed within them.
3. Ensure that the function is otherwise valid and that its removal does not affect other parts of the code (e.g., by removing specific attributes, do not inadvertently alter the function's signature that is expected elsewhere in the code).

Example:
Original Function Declaration:
```cpp
[[nodiscard]] int computeValue(int param) {
    return param * 2;
}
```

Mutated Function Declaration:
```cpp
int computeValue(int param) {
    return param * 2;
}
```

Explanation:
In this mutation, the nodiscard attribute is removed to simulate conditions where the compiler’s handling of attributes is put to the test. By specifically targeting attributes, this mutation operator seeks to uncover bugs related to attribute parsing and management by the compiler. Attributes are metadata that can influence compiler behavior, and mutations here can lead to unexpected compiler responses or crashes, especially in cases where attribute management is flawed.
