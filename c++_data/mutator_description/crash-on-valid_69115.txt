Mutation Operator: Nested Array Initialization Modification

Target Code Construct: Nested array initialization within a function or constexpr function.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a nested array initialization in the code, such as using the form `Type arrayName[size1][size2] = {initialization values};`.

2. Modify the nested array initialization to have a different level of nesting or alter its size:
   a. If the array is initialized directly with values, change the initialization list so that it only initializes a single dimension, e.g., `Type arrayName[size1] = {initialization values};`.
   b. Alternatively, increase the dimensionality of the array by adding another nested layer without providing complete initialization values, e.g., `Type arrayName[size1][size2][size3];`.

3. Ensure the modified array is still used in the code to trigger potential issues with the initialization or access pattern, such as iterating over the array or using it in a structured binding.

Example:
Original:
```
int arr[2][2] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
```

Mutated:
```
int arr[2] = {1, 2}; // Reduced dimensionality
```
or
```
int arr[2][2][2]; // Increased dimensionality without initialization
```

This mutation operator tests the compiler's ability to handle different forms and complexities of nested array initializations, which are known to potentially cause issues in certain implementations.
