Mutation Operator: Modify Concept Definition

Target: C++ concepts

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a concept declaration in the seed program. The concept should look like this: `template <typename T> concept C = expression;`
2. Modify the concept expression to use another existing concept or a boolean operation that results in an invalid or contradictory state.
3. Ensure that the modified concept expression introduces a semantic discrepancy or an ill-defined state.

Step-by-step mutation:
- Locate the concept definition in the code.
- Replace the concept's expression with a boolean operation using existing concepts, such as `concept C2 = C1 && false;` or `concept C2 = !C1;`. Here, `C1` is another concept in the program.
- Alternatively, introduce a self-referential or contradictory expression for the concept, such as `concept C = !C;`.
- Ensure that all components of the new expression are declared and valid in the existing program context.

Example:
Original code:
```
template <typename T> concept Large = sizeof(T) > 4;
```
Mutation:
```
template <typename T> concept Large = Large && sizeof(T) > 4;
```

This mutation operator exploits the potential for semantic errors in concept definitions, particularly when complex constraints or interdependent concepts are involved.
