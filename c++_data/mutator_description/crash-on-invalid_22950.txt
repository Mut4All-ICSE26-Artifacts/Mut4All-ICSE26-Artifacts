Mutation Operator

Target: Inline Assembly and Preprocessor Directives

Mutation Rule: This mutation operator targets the use of inline assembly within C++ code, specifically when combined with preprocessor directives that alter compiler warnings or behaviors. The mutation rule modifies the assembly code and associated directives to create conditions that might lead to unexpected compiler behaviors.

1. Identify a section of the C++ code where inline assembly is used. This is typically found within `__asm__` or `asm` blocks.

2. Locate any associated preprocessor directives that modify compiler behaviors, such as `#pragma clang diagnostic ignored`.

3. Modify the inline assembly code to reference an undefined label or modify the directive to ignore a different compiler warning. For example:
   - Change an existing label in the assembly code to a new, undefined label.
   - Alter the pragma directive to suppress a warning unrelated to the assembly code, such as `-Wunknown-pragmas`.

Example:

Original:
```cpp
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wmissing-noreturn"
__asm__(".Lfoo: movw r2, #:lower16:.Lbar - .Lfoo");
```

Mutated:
```cpp
#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wunused-label"
__asm__(".Lfoo: movw r2, #:lower16:.Lundefined - .Lfoo");
```

In this mutation, the label `.Lbar` is changed to `.Lundefined`, which should not be defined anywhere else in the code. Additionally, the pragma directive is modified to ignore a warning that may not be directly related to the assembly code. This mutation increases the likelihood of triggering compiler errors or unexpected behaviors due to the undefined label and altered compiler diagnostics settings.
