Mutation Operator: Incomplete Using Declaration in Derived Classes

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets the `using` declaration within a derived class that attempts to bring a base class's member or constructor into scope.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `using` declaration in a derived class that correctly specifies a member or constructor from its base class.
2. Remove the identifier following the scope resolution operator (`::`) in the `using` declaration, rendering it incomplete.
3. Ensure the base class and derived class are already defined in the seed program. If no `using` declaration is present, introduce one in the derived class targeting a valid member or constructor from the base class, and then remove the identifier following the `::`.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Base {
protected:
    void function() {}
};

struct Derived : Base {
    using Base::function; // Correct usage
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Base {
protected:
    void function() {}
};

struct Derived : Base {
    using Base::; // Incomplete usage
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
}
```

This mutation involves creating an incomplete `using` declaration, which can lead to syntax errors and potentially trigger compiler crashes when not gracefully handled. This operator is widely applicable to any derived class with a `using` declaration, enhancing coverage and universality.
