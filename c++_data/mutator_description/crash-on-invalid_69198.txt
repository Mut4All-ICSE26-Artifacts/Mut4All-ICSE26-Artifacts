Mutation Operator: Modify Array Declaration with Negative Size

Target Code Construct: Array Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an array declaration within the codebase. The array could be declared globally, locally within a function, or as a member of a struct.
2. Change the size of the array to a negative integer value (e.g., change `int arr[10];` to `int arr[-5];`). Ensure that the negative size is a simple constant expression rather than a variable or complex expression.
3. If the array is declared with a specific element type, retain that type. Only the size of the array should be negative.
4. Ensure that the array declaration is referenced in some context where its size is relevant—such as in a pragma, function parameter, or calculation—to increase the likelihood of triggering a compilation issue.

Example:
Original Code:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int numbers[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        numbers[i] = i * i;
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int numbers[-5]; // Mutated: Array declared with a negative size
    #pragma omp task depend(inout: numbers[:][:]) // Ensures array is processed to increase crash probability
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        numbers[i] = i * i;
    }
}
```

This mutation operator targets array declarations and is designed to exploit issues that arise when the compiler attempts to handle arrays with negative sizes. This is a common scenario that can lead to crashes, especially when interfacing with parallel processing constructs like OpenMP. The mutated array size should directly lead to compilation errors or trigger assertion checks within the compiler, as demonstrated in the provided bug report.
