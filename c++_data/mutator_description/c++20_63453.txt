Mutation Operator: Modify Switch Statement Control Expression

Target Code Construct: Switch statement within a function.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a switch statement within a function.
2. Ensure the switch statement is using a variable or expression as its control expression.
3. Replace the control expression of the switch statement with an undeclared identifier or a non-initialized variable.

Example:

Original Code:
```
int bar(int a) {
    switch (a) {
    case 0:
        return 1;
    default:
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
int bar(int a) {
    switch (undeclaredVar) { // 'undeclaredVar' is not declared anywhere in the program
    case 0:
        return 1;
    default:
        return 0;
    }
}
```

This mutation operator is designed to exploit the scenario where the control expression of a switch statement leads to a crash or undefined behavior when the expression is undeclared or invalid. This has high coverage as it can be applied to any switch statement with a variable control expression.
