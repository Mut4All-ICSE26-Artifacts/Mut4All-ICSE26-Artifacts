Mutation Operator: Incorrect Initialization Order in Array Definitions

Target Code Construct: Array initialization with unintended static storage duration.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify array declarations that lack explicit types and contain assignments or initializations that depend on later-declared variables.
2. Modify the initialization to introduce a static storage duration variable inappropriately, leading to a crash or assertion in a C++ compiler.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate an array declaration and initialization without a specified type, e.g., `arr[] = {val1 = var2}`.
- Ensure the presence of a static storage duration variable declared after the array declaration but accessed during the array's initialization.
- Change the initialization such that it incorrectly depends on a variable yet to be defined within the same scope, potentially causing undefined behavior.

Example in Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
int main() {
    x; // Unspecified type
    const y;
    z[] = {y = x}; // Array declaration and initialization
    static w = z;  // Inappropriate static storage duration variable
}
```

After Mutation:
```
int main() {
    x; // Unspecified type
    const y;
    static w = y; // Erroneous use of static storage duration
    z[] = {y = x}; // Array declaration and initialization
}
```

This operator forces the compiler into a situation where it must handle incorrect initialization orders and static storage, increasing the likelihood of triggering assertion failures or crashes when semantic checks are applied.
