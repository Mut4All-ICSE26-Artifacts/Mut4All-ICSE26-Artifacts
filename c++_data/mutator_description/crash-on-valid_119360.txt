Mutation Operator: Modify va_arg with Incompatible Type

Target Code Construct: va_arg usage inside a variadic function

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a function that uses `va_list` and `va_arg` to handle variadic arguments.
2. Identify the line where `va_arg` is used to retrieve an argument.
3. Modify the type in the `va_arg` call to an incompatible or impossible type construct, specifically changing an array type to a different non-compatible type.
4. Ensure the modified type does not align with the expected argument type and cannot be cast to the original type without causing an error.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
va_list args;
va_start(args, size);
(uint8_t*)va_arg(args, uint8_t[size]);
va_end(args);
```

Mutation:
1. Change `uint8_t[size]` to a pointer to a function type, which is incompatible with the original array type.
2. The modified line should now read:
   ```cpp
   (uint8_t*)va_arg(args, uint8_t(*)(void));
   ```

Note: This mutation introduces an unexpected function pointer type in place of the array type, which is intended to disrupt the proper handling of variadic arguments and trigger potential compiler crashes or errors during code generation. The choice of a function pointer highlights incompatibility and increases the likelihood of triggering code generation issues.
