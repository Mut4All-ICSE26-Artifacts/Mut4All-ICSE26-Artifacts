Mutation Operator: Alias Template Instantiation in Class Templates

Target Code Construct: Instantiation of alias templates within class templates without specifying the `typename` keyword where necessary.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template or a struct that contains an alias template declaration. For example:
   ```
   struct MyStruct {
     template<typename = Type1> using MyAlias = ReturnType;
   };
   ```
2. Within a template function or variable declaration, instantiate the alias template from the struct or class template. Avoid using the `typename` keyword where necessary to trigger potential compiler issues. For instance:
   ```
   template<typename U> ResultType func = U::template MyAlias<>;
   ```
3. Explicitly instantiate the template with a specific type that has the alias template, similar to:
   ```
   template ResultType func<MyStruct>;
   ```
   
Ensure the alias template is a proper candidate for instantiation within the context of the given class or struct, and the types used are valid within the scope of the available declarations and types. This mutation operator helps in testing the compiler's ability to handle alias template instantiations in varying contexts, especially when dependent types are involved.
