Mutation Operator:
Target: Destructor Declaration in Class

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class definition in the seed program.
2. Add a destructor declaration with an incomplete specifier to the class. This means declaring a destructor without the proper complete type specification. For example, declare the destructor without using the class name correctly.
3. Ensure the destructor is written as `~` followed by a type or name that does not match the class name exactly, or use an incomplete type, leading to a syntax error.

Example Pseudocode:
Original Code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    ~MyClass();
};
```
Mutated Code:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    ~IncompleteType();
};
```

Instructions:
- Start by locating a class in the seed program where you can introduce or modify a destructor.
- Introduce a destructor by using a tilde `~` followed by an incorrect type name, such as an incomplete type or a name not matching the class.
- Verify that the mutation results in an inconsistency in the destructor definition, which should prompt a failure in the compiler's semantic analysis phase, potentially triggering a crash similar to the bug described.
