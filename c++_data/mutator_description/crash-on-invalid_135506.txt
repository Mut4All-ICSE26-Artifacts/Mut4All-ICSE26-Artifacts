Mutation Operator: Modify the Destructor Defaulting

Target: Class destructors, specifically those that are defaulted.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class with a defaulted destructor in the seed program.
2. Change the defaulted destructor to a regular destructor with a simple implementation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a class definition which has a defaulted destructor, typically declared like this:
  ```
  class MyClass {
  public:
      ~MyClass() = default;
  };
  ```
- Modify the defaulted destructor to a custom-defined destructor with an empty block or a simple operation:
  ```
  class MyClass {
  public:
      ~MyClass() {
          // Simple operation or leave it empty
      }
  };
  ```

Reasoning:
Defaulted destructors, especially when combined with constexpr or other complex qualifiers, can lead to intricate interactions within the compiler's handling of default semantics. By altering it to a regular, albeit simple, destructor, we can observe how the compiler handles the destructor logic without default semantics, potentially triggering the reported issue in a broader set of cases. This mutation operator has high applicability because many classes could potentially use defaulted destructors, making it widely adaptable.
