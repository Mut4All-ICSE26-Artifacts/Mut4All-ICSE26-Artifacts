Mutation Operator: Misuse of Template Instantiation

Target: This mutation operator targets template instantiation involving standard library containers such as `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::map`, etc.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a line of code where a standard library container is instantiated, for example: 
   `std::vector<int> v;`
2. Modify the instantiation by replacing the angle brackets `<>` with incorrect syntax such as parentheses `()` or omit them entirely.
3. After applying this mutation, the incorrect instantiation should look like:
   - Incorrect: `std::vector(int) v;`
   - Or: `std::vector v;`

Example:
Original Code:
```
#include <vector>
int main() {
    std::vector<int> numbers;
    return 0;
}
```
Mutated Code:
```
#include <vector>
int main() {
    std::vector numbers; // Angle brackets removed
    return 0;
}
```
The mutated code is expected to cause the compiler to process an invalid template instantiation, potentially leading to a crash in scenarios where the compiler mishandles the incorrect syntax.
