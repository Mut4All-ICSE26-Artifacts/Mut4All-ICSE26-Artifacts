Mutation Operator: Modify Function Template with Concept Constraints

Target Code Construct:
- Function templates with concept constraints applied.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template that employs a concept constraint, similar to the `f` function in the provided bug report.
2. Alter the concept constraint to a more nested or recursive structure. This can involve adding additional levels of concepts or requirements which are interdependent.
3. Ensure the modified function template is called within the code, using arguments that require the compiler to resolve the nested concept constraints.

Example:
Original Template:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept BasicConcept = requires(T t) { someFunction(t); };

template<BasicConcept T>
void myFunction(T t) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

Mutation:
1. Introduce a new concept that refers to the existing concept in a nested manner.
2. Apply this new concept to the function template.

```cpp
template<typename T>
concept RecursiveConcept = BasicConcept<T> && requires(T t) { anotherFunction(t); };

template<RecursiveConcept T>
void myFunction(T t) {
    // Function implementation
}
```

3. Ensure that `myFunction` is called with arguments that challenge the compiler's ability to check the constraints, such as by using types that are close to fulfilling but do not completely satisfy the `RecursiveConcept`.

```cpp
void exampleUsage() {
    myFunction(someVariable);
}
```

Explanation:
- This mutation introduces additional complexity in the concept constraint hierarchy, potentially exercising more code paths in the compiler's constraint checking logic.
- By creating interdependent concept requirements, the compiler is forced to resolve more intricate relationships, which may expose assertion failures or other issues in its concept handling logic.
