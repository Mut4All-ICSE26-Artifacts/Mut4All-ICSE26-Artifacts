Mutation Operator: Explicit Specialization of Base Inherited Constructor

Target Code Construct: Class constructor within derived classes, specifically those that inherit constructors from a base class.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class `Derived` that inherits from a base class `Base`.
2. Ensure that `Base` has one or more constructors.
3. In `Derived`, explicitly inherit a constructor from `Base` using the `using` keyword.
4. Create an explicit specialization of the inherited constructor in `Derived`.
5. Use a template specialization for the constructor in `Derived`, even if it's not necessary.

Step-by-step Instructions:
1. Assume `Base` and `Derived` are defined as follows:

```
class Base {
public:
    Base(int x) {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
    using Base::Base;
};
```

2. Modify `Derived` to specialize the inherited constructor:

- Add a template specialization for the constructor in `Derived`.

Example:

```
class Derived : public Base {
    using Base::Base;

    template<>
    Derived(int x) : Base(x) {}
};
```

Explanation:
This mutation operator exploits a nuanced area of the C++ language involving constructor inheritance and explicit specialization. By forcing a template specialization where it's not typically required, this operator may expose inconsistencies in the compiler's handling of inherited constructors, potentially triggering a crash or assertion failure in the compiler frontend.
