Mutation Operator: Template Instantiation with Conditional Dependency

Target: Template functions and their instantiation conditions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function with a conditional dependency within its instantiation, such as `enable_if`.
2. Modify the condition used in `enable_if` to involve a type trait or a dependent type that is not guaranteed to exist or be valid for certain instantiations.
3. Specifically, target a condition that uses a static member or property of a template parameter class (e.g., `Foo<T>::bar`) and alter it to reference a member that might not exist for some instantiations, such as a non-existent static constant or type alias.

Example:
Original:
template <typename T>
static typename enable_if<Foo<T>::bar, void>::Type method()
{
}

Mutation:
Modify the condition `Foo<T>::bar` to a member that might not always exist, for example:
template <typename T>
static typename enable_if<Foo<T>::non_existent_member, void>::Type method()
{
}

This mutation operator will test the compiler's handling of template instantiation with conditions that lead to invalid types or states, increasing the likelihood of encountering bugs related to improper handling of type-dependent conditions.
