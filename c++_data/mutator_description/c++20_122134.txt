Mutation Operator: Modify Template Type Deduction

Target Code Construct: Template Type Aliases with Default Arguments

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template type alias that has a default template argument. This can be a type alias defined using the `using` keyword, which includes a default value for one or more of its template parameters.
2. Change the default template argument to another type or value that is compatible but semantically different. This modification should aim to test how the compiler deals with type deduction when defaults are altered.
3. If the template type alias references a template that uses constraints or concepts, ensure the new default argument still satisfies those constraints, but in a different manner.
4. Apply this mutation where the template type alias is directly instantiated or used in the code, such as in function calls or object creation.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <class T, int N = 0> using ExampleAlias = SomeTemplate<T, N>;

void function() {
    ExampleAlias<int> instance; // uses default N = 0
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <class T, int N = 1> using ExampleAlias = SomeTemplate<T, N>;

void function() {
    ExampleAlias<int> instance; // uses new default N = 1
}
```

This mutation operator targets the nuanced behavior of template instantiation and type deduction, which are areas often involved in compiler bugs, particularly in complex C++20 constructs involving default arguments and concepts.
