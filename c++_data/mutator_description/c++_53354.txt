Mutation Operator: Modify Template Parameter Constraints

Target Code Construct: Template Class Specialization Requirements

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template class that has partial specialization with constraints, such as a `struct` or `class` with `requires` clauses.
2. Within the partial specialization that uses constraints, modify the requirement expression by adding, removing, or altering the concept or requires clause.
3. Specifically, for each `requires` clause within the template specialization:
   - Add a logical operation (such as `&&` or `||`) combined with a condition that interacts with the template parameter in a non-trivial way. For example, use an expression like `sizeof(T) < 10` or `sizeof(T) == 8`.
   - Alternatively, replace the existing constraint with a new one that is logically different but still syntactically valid, such as changing `sizeof(T) > 4` to `sizeof(T) != 4`.
4. Ensure the mutated condition involves properties of the template parameter that could interact with the compiler's constraint-checking mechanisms.

Example:
Given the original requirement:
```cpp
template <class T>
  requires C1<T> && C2<T>
struct A<T> {};
```

Mutation Example:
```cpp
template <class T>
  requires C1<T> && (sizeof(T) != 4)
struct A<T> {};
```

This mutation can potentially trigger issues with constraint satisfaction or specialization resolution, especially if the original logic was crucial for template parameter substitution and constraint handling in the compiler.
