Mutation Operator: Namespace Misplacement in Structs

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets struct declarations with incorrectly placed namespace usage in relation to member declarations.

Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a struct that contains at least one member variable or function declaration.
Step 2: Insert a namespace declaration within the struct that references an existing namespace in the context of the seed program. Ensure that the namespace is incorrectly placed such that it disrupts the sequence of member declarations or is syntactically misplaced.
Step 3: Verify that the inserted namespace declaration includes at least one using directive for a type or function that exists within the referenced namespace.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct B {
    int number;
    void display();
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct B {
    int number;
    namespace using ::std; // Misplaced namespace usage
    void display();
};
```

This mutation operator exploits the C++ compiler's handling of misplaced namespace declarations within structs, potentially triggering crashes or assertion failures when the compiler processes invalid code constructs.
