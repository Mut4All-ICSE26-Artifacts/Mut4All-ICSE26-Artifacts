Mutation Operator:

Target: Function Declaration with Target-Specific Attributes

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any function in the seed program that uses the `__attribute__` or `[[gnu::]]` syntax to specify target-specific attributes (e.g., `target_version`, `target`, etc.).
2. Replace the architecture-specific attribute value with an unsupported or unrelated architecture to the current compiler's target triple.
3. Specifically, change the target specification to a value that is not suitable for the current compilation target, such as changing "aes" to an unsupported string like "unsupported_arch".
4. Ensure that the surrounding function structure remains syntactically correct, and no other part of the function definition is altered apart from the attribute specification.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```cpp
__attribute__((target("aes")))
void myFunction() {
    // Function body
}
```

After Mutation:
```cpp
__attribute__((target("unsupported_arch")))
void myFunction() {
    // Function body
}
```

This mutation operator targets the handling of target-specific attributes within function declarations, which are prone to triggering compiler bugs if the attribute does not align with the compiler's current target architecture. By introducing an unsupported architecture string, it is likely to expose assertion failures or crash bugs related to incorrect target handling.
