Mutation Operator: Alter Function Call Arguments in Concepts

Target: This mutation operator targets function calls within a conceptual context, specifically those involving template parameters or concepts.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function call within a code construct that involves a concept requirement, such as a function template or a lambda expression involved in a template constraint.
2. If the function call passes arguments that are derived from or related to concepts, replace one of the arguments with a function or type that introduces ambiguity or complexity in substitution. This could be a function returning a non-convertible type or a type that does not satisfy the concept constraints.
3. Ensure that the modified argument does not directly match any existing overloads or expected types to introduce a potential substitution failure or template instantiation issue.

Example:
- Original Code:
  ```cpp
  template <typename T>
  concept Incrementable = requires(T a) {
    { ++a } -> std::same_as<T&>;
  };

  template <Incrementable T>
  void increment(T& val) {
    ++val;
  }

  int x = 5;
  increment(x);
  ```

- Mutated Code:
  ```cpp
  struct NonIncrementable {
    int operator++(int) { return 0; } // Post-increment only, not satisfying the concept
  };

  NonIncrementable y;
  increment(y); // This should cause a concept substitution failure due to requirement mismatch
  ```

Explanation:
By replacing the argument passed to the `increment` function with an instance of `NonIncrementable`, we introduce a scenario where the concept requirement fails. This can provoke the compiler into handling a complex concept substitution case, potentially triggering internal handling errors if there are edge cases not properly addressed in the compiler's type resolution logic.
