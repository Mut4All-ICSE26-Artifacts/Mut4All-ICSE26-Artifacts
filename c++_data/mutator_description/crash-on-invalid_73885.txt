Mutation Operator: Modify Template Constraints

Target Code Construct: Variable templates with constraints

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a variable template that uses a constraint, for example:
   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   concept SampleConcept = true;

   template <SampleConcept T>
   constexpr T sample_v = 42;
   ```
2. Modify the template constraint to an invalid one by introducing a mismatch between the constraint and the variable template usage. Specifically, use a concept that does not match or is not applicable to the intended type, such as:

   - Change the concept used in the template parameter so that it causes mismatch or does not apply to the type being used for instantiation.
   - Intentionally create a scenario where the concept constraints are logically inconsistent or incorrect based on the intended usage.

3. Apply the mutation and compile to observe if the change causes a crash or unexpected behavior in the compiler when resolving constraints.

Example Pseudo-code Mutation:
```cpp
// Original code with constraints
template <typename T>
concept ValidConcept = true;

template <ValidConcept T>
constexpr T valid_var = 42;

// Mutation: Modify the concept usage to cause mismatch
template <typename T>
concept InvalidConcept = false; // Constraint that is always false

template <InvalidConcept T> // This will cause a logical inconsistency
constexpr T invalid_var = 42; // Instantiation should fail
```

By creating a scenario where the concept constraints are logically inconsistent or conflict with the intended usage, this mutation operator targets potential compiler weaknesses in template constraint satisfaction and evaluation, likely leading to crashes or misbehaviors when processing the modified code.
