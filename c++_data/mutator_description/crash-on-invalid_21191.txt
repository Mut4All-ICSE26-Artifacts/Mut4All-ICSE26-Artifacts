Mutation Operator: Invalid Use of decltype with Generic Lambda

Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets generic lambda expressions within the code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression within the code, especially one that is marked as generic (using auto in the parameter list).
2. Add a decltype expression that evaluates the result of the lambda using an invalid or incomplete context.
3. Insert the decltype expression immediately after the lambda definition.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a lambda expression in the program code that is declared with auto parameters. For instance, find a line similar to `auto myLambda = [](auto x) { return x; };`.
- Directly after this lambda definition, introduce a decltype expression that attempts to deduce the type of a generic call without sufficient context. Specifically, use a call to the lambda without providing a proper instantiation of the template parameter.
- An example mutation could be adding the line `decltype(myLambda()) invalidType;` after the lambda definition. This should be done in a way that triggers typing or instantiation errors because the lambda expects a parameter, but it was called with none.

Example:
Original:
```
auto myLambda = [](auto x) { return x; };
int main() {
    auto result = myLambda(5);
}
```

Mutated:
```
auto myLambda = [](auto x) { return x; };
decltype(myLambda()) invalidType; // This line is added
int main() {
    auto result = myLambda(5);
}
```

Explanation:
The mutation operator intentionally induces an error by using decltype incorrectly, leading to a situation where the type cannot be deduced properly by the compiler, especially when templates and generic lambdas are involved. This technique exploits the compiler's handling of templates and type deduction mechanisms, potentially triggering a bug as described in the bug report.
