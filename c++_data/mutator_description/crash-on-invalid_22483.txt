Mutation Operator:
Target: Lambda Expressions in Function Calls

Mutation Rule: Modify the lambda expression's capture clause to include a non-existent or undefined variable, triggering a potential compiler crash when the lambda is instantiated.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Identify the lambda expression within a function call in the seed program. This could be a lambda being passed to another function or used within a function call.
2. Check the capture clause of the lambda expression. This is the part of the lambda that specifies which variables are captured from the surrounding scope.
3. Introduce a new variable name in the capture clause that is not declared in the current scope or any enclosing scope. This should specifically be a variable that does not exist in the program, leading to an ill-formed lambda.
4. Ensure that the rest of the lambda body remains unchanged to isolate the mutation to the capture clause.

Example:
Original code excerpt:
```
void ExampleFunction(int z) {
  auto myLambda = [z]() { return z + 1; };
  myLambda();
}
```

Mutation example:
```
void ExampleFunction(int z) {
  auto myLambda = [z, nonExistentVar]() { return z + 1; }; // nonExistentVar is not declared
  myLambda();
}
```

By introducing `nonExistentVar` in the capture clause, the lambda becomes ill-formed, which may exercise a bug related to handling invalid lambda expressions during compilation.
