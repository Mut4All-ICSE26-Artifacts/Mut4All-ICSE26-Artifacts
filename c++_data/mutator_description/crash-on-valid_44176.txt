Mutation Operator
Target: Array Dimension Declaration and Initialization
Applicable to: Arrays within any function or global scope

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any array declaration within a given scope. For example, locate declarations like `int arr[10];`.
2. Modify the array size to use an arithmetic or logical expression instead of a direct integer value. For example, change `int arr[10];` to `int arr[10 + 5 * 0];` or `int arr[10 && 1];`.
3. Ensure that the expression results in a valid integer type. Use simple expressions that include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or logical AND/OR operations.
4. If using division, ensure the divisor is non-zero to maintain validity.
5. Verify that the array is used in subsequent code to ensure that the mutation affects the code execution and potential interaction with the compiler.

Example:
Original Code:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int numbers[10];
    // Some operations on numbers
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
void exampleFunction() {
    int numbers[10 + 5 * 0];
    // Some operations on numbers
}
```

Purpose:
The mutation creates a scenario where the array declaration relies on expressions, which can inadvertently expose compiler behavior when evaluating constant expressions or other unusual arithmetic/logical evaluations during declaration. This technique is useful for detecting issues in the compiler's handling of complex array declarations and potential side-effects during constant folding or expression evaluation.
