Mutation Operator

Target Code Construct: Class Template Method

Mutation Rule: Modify the method implementation within a class template to introduce multiple levels of dependent types and unqualified lookups, which are known to challenge template resolution. The mutation should focus on altering the use of base class methods and member pointers in a template-dependent context.

Step-by-Step Mutation Instructions:
1. Identify a method within a class template where template parameters influence the method's implementation.
2. Introduce a base class to the existing class template, ensuring that this base class declares a method which will be utilized in the template class via a pointer to member function.
3. In the template method, use a pointer to a member function of the dependent base class to reference a method that has not been declared in the derived template class, attempting unqualified lookup.
4. Cast this pointer to a member function type using the base class, and call this member function through the cast pointer.

Example:
Given a class template:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class CTest : public Base {
public:
    bool CheckValid() {
        // Original implementation
    }
};
```

Mutation:
1. Add a base class `Base` with a method `IsValid`.
2. Modify `CheckValid` to use a pointer to `IsValid` through the base class.
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    bool IsValid() const { return true; }
};

template<typename T>
class CTest : public Base {
public:
    bool CheckValid() {
        return (this->*static_cast<bool (Base::*)()const>(&Base::IsValid))();
    }
};
```

This mutation operator challenges the compiler's ability to correctly perform unqualified lookups and handle dependent base class member pointers, potentially triggering issues in template and name resolution.
