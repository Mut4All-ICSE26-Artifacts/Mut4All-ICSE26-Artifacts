Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Function Template with Constrained Call

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets lambda functions that are defined as variable templates with constraints, specifically within the context of a templated variable.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda function that is defined as a variable template with a constraint, similar to `auto f = []() requires c<void> { };`.
2. Modify the constraint to use a different, potentially incompatible type in the constraint check.
3. Ensure that the function or lambda is invoked in a context that can potentially cause a type mismatch or constraint failure.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Locate a lambda function defined as a variable template with a constraint, such as:
   ```
   template<typename>
   auto f = []() requires c<void> { };
   ```
2. Change the constraint type from `void` to another type, e.g., `int` or a non-related type.
   ```
   template<typename>
   auto f = []() requires c<int> { };
   ```
3. Ensure the lambda is called in a function that uses template instantiation with a type that does not satisfy the new constraint. For instance, if the original constraint was satisfied with `void`, the call should now use a type that does not meet the `int` constraint.
   ```
   void g() {
       f<double>(); // Assuming double does not satisfy the new c<int> constraint
   }
   ```
4. Compile the modified code to trigger the potential crash or assertion failure.

By changing the type in the constraint and ensuring a mismatch in the function call context, this mutation operator can trigger bugs related to constraint satisfaction in lambda function templates.
