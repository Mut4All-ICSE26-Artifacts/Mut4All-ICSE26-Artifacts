Mutation Operator 1: Template Function Exception Specification Mutation

Target Construct:
This mutation operator targets template functions with exception specifications in C++ code.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function declaration or definition in the source code with an explicit exception specification.
2. Modify the exception specification to include an uninstantiated exception type to potentially trigger the same assertion failure related to exception specification instantiation.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Locate a template function in the source code. For example:
   ```cpp
   template<typename T>
   void exampleFunction() noexcept(false);
   ```

2. Change the exception specification to use an uninstantiated template type, which may lead to issues during the template instantiation process. Replace the existing exception specification with a placeholder for an exception type that is not currently defined or instantiated:
   ```cpp
   template<typename T>
   void exampleFunction() noexcept(T());
   ```

3. Ensure that the type `T` does not have a valid exception type instantiated at the point of function declaration or definition. If necessary, create a template specialization or a usage context where `T` is not defined for exception purposes, leading to an uninstantiated state.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
void performAction() noexcept(false) {
   // Implementation
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
void performAction() noexcept(T()) {
   // Implementation
}
```

Note:
This mutation operator aims to explore uninstantiated exception specifications, exploiting potential compiler weaknesses in handling template instantiation processes, especially those involving exception specifications.
