Mutation Operator: Modify Array Declaration with Negative Size

Target Construct: Array Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an array declaration in the seed program.
2. Change the size of the declared array to a negative integer value.
3. Ensure that the negative size is a constant integer expression.

Example:
- Original Code: int arr[10];
- Mutated Code: int arr[-5]; 

In this instance, the array 'arr' is modified to have a negative size of '-5'. This mutation is specifically designed to trigger errors related to invalid array sizes in C++ compilers, potentially leading to a compiler crash due to incorrect handling of such cases.
