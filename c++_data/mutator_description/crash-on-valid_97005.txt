Mutation Operator:

Target: Conditional (ternary) operator

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a ternary operator in the code, which is generally structured as `condition ? expr1 : expr2`.
2. Ensure `expr1` and `expr2` are of different array types, for example, one of type `const unsigned char[]` and the other `const unsigned char[N]` where `N` is a specific number.
3. Confirm that the condition is a boolean type.
4. Modify `expr1` to become an array type with an explicit size specified, different from the original implicit or different size used in `expr2`.
5. Ensure that the modification uses existing array variables, or declare a new one ensuring the array size differences are prominent.

Example:
Original code:
```
bool condition;
constexpr const unsigned char array1[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
constexpr const unsigned char array2[3] = { 4, 5, 6 };
auto result = (condition ? array1 : array2);
```

Mutation example:
```
bool condition;
constexpr const unsigned char array1[3] = { 1, 2, 3 };
constexpr const unsigned char array2[4] = { 4, 5, 6, 7 };
auto result = (condition ? array1 : array2);
```

This mutation operator focuses on the conditional operator where mismatched array types are present, which may lead to unexpected behaviors or crashes in handling type compatibility in the compiler.
