Mutation Operator: Template Parameter Type Mismatch

This mutation operator targets template definitions and instantiations, specifically when template parameters are expected to match a particular type but are mismatched with a different type.

Step-by-step mutation rule:

1. Identify a template declaration that involves a class template parameter. For example, a template declaration such as `template<template<ClassType> class>`.

2. Check the expected type of the template parameter. For instance, in the provided bug, `template<X> class` expects a template parameter of type `X`.

3. Locate the instantiation of the identified template. In the bug example, the instantiation is `template struct A<B>;` where `B` should match `X`.

4. Introduce a mismatch in the template parameter type by modifying the instantiation to use a template that does not conform to the expected class type. For example, change to `template struct A<C>;` where `C` is a different class type, not previously defined as matching `X`.

5. Ensure that the new class type (`C`) is defined in the code. For instance:
   ```
   struct C {
     // intentionally differs from struct X
   };
   ```

This mutation operator aims to introduce a type mismatch scenario that can lead to assertion failures or crashes during template matching in the compiler frontend.
