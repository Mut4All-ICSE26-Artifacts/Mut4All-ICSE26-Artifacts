Mutation Operator: Template Parameter Manipulation

Target Code Construct: Class Templates with Static Data Members

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class template that defines a static data member.
2. Ensure the static data member's type depends on a template parameter.
3. Introduce a deduced type for the static data member based on a template parameter.
4. Instantiate the class template with a template parameter that results in a deduced type resolving.
5. Use this instantiated member in an expression or assignment in the code.

Example:
Original Code Structure:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MyClass {
    static T value;
};

// Usage
int main() {
    auto val = MyClass<int>::value;
}
```

Mutation Steps:
1. Modify the template to include a deduced type for the static data member.
2. Instantiate the template with a specific type that results in a deduced static member type.
3. Use the static member in a statement to trigger potential parsing issues.

Mutated Example:
```cpp
template<typename T>
class MyClass {
    static decltype(T{}) value; // Deduced type for the static member
};

// Usage
int main() {
    auto val = MyClass<int>::value; // Use the deduced static member
}
```

This mutation operator targets the use of deduced types in static data members of class templates, aiming to expose potential issues in the compiler when handling such constructs.
