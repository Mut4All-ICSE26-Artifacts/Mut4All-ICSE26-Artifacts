Mutation Operator: Modify Lambda Expression with Pack Expansion

Target Construct: Lambda Expressions with Pack Expansion 

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a lambda expression that uses a parameter pack (e.g., `auto... a`).
2. Identify a fold expression using pack expansion within the lambda body (e.g., `(expression + ...)` or `(expression, ...)`).
3. Modify the fold expression by changing its operation. If it uses a `+` operation, change it to another binary operation like `*`, `-`, or `/`. If it uses a comma `,`, change it to another operator like `+` or `*`.
4. Ensure that the modified operation is supported by the types involved in the pack expansion. If not, modify the expression to cast the types appropriately or adjust the operation to be valid.

Example Pseudo-Code:
Original:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto... a) { return (([a] {}, 0) + ...); };
```

Mutated:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](auto... a) { return (([a] {}, 0) * ...); };
```

The mutation alters the operation used in the fold expression, potentially exploiting edge cases in the compiler's handling of fold expressions and pack expansions.
