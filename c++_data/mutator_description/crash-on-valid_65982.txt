Mutation Operator: Modify Inheritance and Access Specifiers

1. Target Code Construct: This mutation operator targets struct inheritance and access specifiers specifically involving virtual inheritance and member access using derived classes.

2. Mutation Rule:
   a. Identify a derived struct that inherits from a base struct using virtual inheritance.
   b. Change the inheritance type from virtual to non-virtual for all derived structs involved.
   c. Change the way members are accessed via derived classes, removing scope resolution if it involves multiple inheritance. If using a base member from multiple inheritance, explicitly use scope resolution to enforce base class member access.

3. Example of Mutation Steps:
   a. Original Structure:
   ```
   struct base {
       int k{2};
   };

   struct A : virtual public base {
   };

   struct B : virtual public base {
   };

   template<typename...args>
   struct X : public args... {
       using args::k ...;
   };

   void t(void) {
       X<A, B> x;
       x.A::k=1;
       return;
   }
   ```

   b. Mutated Structure:
   - Change virtual inheritance to non-virtual:
   ```
   struct A : public base {
   };

   struct B : public base {
   };
   ```

   - Adjust member access:
   ```
   void t(void) {
       X<A, B> x;
       x.k = 1; // Access directly without scope resolution
       return;
   }
   ```

4. Explanation of Mutation:
   The mutation involves changing the inheritance model from virtual to non-virtual, which affects how base class members are accessed in the presence of multiple inheritance. This is done to test the C++ compiler's handling of member access rights and inheritance resolution, which could potentially reveal bugs related to memory layout or access path mismanagement.
