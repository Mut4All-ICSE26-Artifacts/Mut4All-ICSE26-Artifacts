Mutation Operator: Modify Arithmetic Expressions with Labels

Targeted Construct: Function Body

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an arithmetic expression involving labels (e.g., &&label1 - &&label2).
2. Replace one of the labels with a defined variable or a constant value within the scope, ensuring proper type compatibility.
3. Modify the expression to use a standard arithmetic operation that is valid for the types involved (e.g., addition or subtraction of integers).

Steps:
- Locate a function with an arithmetic expression involving address labels, such as in the form `&&label1 - &&label2`.
- Choose one of the labels (e.g., &&label1) to replace.
- If there's an existing integer variable in the program, use it; otherwise, introduce a new integer variable or constant.
- Modify the expression to perform arithmetic with the variable or constant.
- Example before mutation: `&&label1 - &&label2`.
- Example after mutation: `int a = 10; a - &&label2`.

Rationale:
This mutation operator targets the compiler's handling of non-standard C constructs like address labels in arithmetic expressions. By converting these into more standard expressions involving variables, we can explore how the compiler processes label manipulations and potentially uncover more robust bugs.
