Mutation Operator: Modify Deallocation Function

Target Code Construct: Global scope operators (specifically new and delete operators).

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any existing global operator new or operator delete functions defined in the seed program. This includes any custom definitions of these operators.
2. Introduce a new declaration of operator delete in the global scope immediately after any existing custom operator new, if one is defined. If no custom operator new is found, apply the mutation to introduce a custom operator delete as follows:
   a. If there is a custom implementation of operator new, immediately follow it with a corresponding implementation of operator delete like so:
      Example:
      ```
      void* operator new(decltype(sizeof(int))) {
          // Existing implementation
          return malloc(sizeof(int));
      }
      // Introduce the following line
      void operator delete(void* ptr) noexcept {
          free(ptr);
      }
      ```
   b. If there is no custom operator new, add the operator delete in the global scope.
      Example:
      ```
      // Introduce the following line in global scope
      void operator delete(void* ptr) noexcept {
          free(ptr);
      }
      ```
3. Ensure the operator delete implementation is complete and syntactically correct, using standard memory deallocation functions like free(ptr).

This mutation targets the linkage and interactions with global scope operators, which can often trigger compiler analysis issues due to required operator semantics in template or PCH contexts.
