Mutation Operator: Incomplete Static Assertion

Target Code Construct: Static Assertions

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a static assertion within the code, which is typically structured as `static_assert(const_expr, message);`.
2. Modify the static assertion by ensuring the assertion message is incomplete, leaving the message part as a starting quote without a closing quote. This simulates the incomplete string scenario.
3. Ensure the constant expression part (`const_expr`) remains valid to avoid masking the effect of the incomplete message.

Example:
- Locate: `static_assert(condition, "This is a valid message");`
- Mutate to: `static_assert(condition, "This is an incomplete message);`

This mutation leverages the tendency for C++ compilers to mishandle or crash when dealing with improperly terminated strings in static assertions, causing assertion failures or parsing errors that lead to a crash. The operator's universality and coverage are strengthened by not requiring any new types or variables and focusing on an existing construct that could exist in various C++ codebases.
