Mutation Operator: Modify List Initialization in Function Templates

Target Code Construct: Function templates that utilize list initialization within their body.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template within the given code.
2. Locate any instances of decltype expressions used within list initialization, particularly those utilizing a function return type.
3. Replace the list initialization with a direct construction that does not utilize an initializer list. If necessary, introduce a temporary variable to hold the return value of the function call before initialization.
4. Ensure that the type being constructed is compatible with direct construction without an initializer list.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <class Dummy>
void S::f() {
  auto _ = decltype(g()){};
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <class Dummy>
void S::f() {
  decltype(g()) tempVar = g(); // Introduce a temporary variable
  auto _ = tempVar;            // Direct construction without initializer list
}
```

This mutation operator targets constructs where list initialization might be incorrectly handled in templates, particularly when dealing with return types of functions. By replacing such initializations with direct assignments, we provoke the compiler to handle the underlying type in a straightforward manner, potentially exposing bugs in type construction handling.
