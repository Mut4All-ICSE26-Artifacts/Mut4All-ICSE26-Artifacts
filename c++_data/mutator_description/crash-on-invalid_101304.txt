Based on the bug report, C++ compiler bugs are more likely to be triggered by structures involving incomplete types, invalid use of the `constexpr` keyword, and assertions related to type casting within the compiler's internal logic. The mutation operator should focus on manipulating these areas to increase the likelihood of exposing similar bugs.

Mutation Operator:
- Target: `constexpr` declarations with incomplete or inappropriate types.
- Applies to: Any variable declaration that uses the `constexpr` specifier.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a `constexpr` variable declaration in the seed program.
2. Replace the current type with an incomplete type. This can be done by:
   a. Declaring a struct without defining its members.
   b. Attempting to use this incomplete struct type as the type of the `constexpr` variable.

Example in Natural Language:
- Locate a `constexpr` variable declaration such as `constexpr int a = 1;`.
- Declare an incomplete struct, e.g., `struct Y;` without defining its content.
- Change the type of the `constexpr` variable `a` to the incomplete struct type, resulting in `constexpr struct Y a = { 0 };`.

This mutation operator directly targets improper `constexpr` usage with incomplete types, exposing potential assertions or crashes within type-checking or casting operations in the compiler.
