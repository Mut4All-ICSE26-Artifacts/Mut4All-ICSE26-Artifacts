Mutation Operator: Modify Type in `__typeof__` Expression

Target Construct: Template Function

Application Context: This mutation targets template functions that utilize `__typeof__` in conjunction with `sizeof(c)`, where `c` is a template parameter, and involves conditions or expressions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Locate a template function that uses `__typeof__` with `sizeof(c)` in its body, where `c` is a template parameter.
2. Identify the `__typeof__` expression and the associated type comparison, e.g., `__typeof__(sizeof(c) <= 1)`.
3. Modify the `sizeof(c) <= 1` expression to a different condition that involves arithmetic or bit manipulation operations. Ensure the condition remains syntactically valid but presents a different type of computation.
4. Replace `â‰¤` with another relational operator (e.g., `>`, `<`, `==`, etc.) and introduce a new arithmetic or bitwise operation within the expression. For instance, modify the condition to `__typeof__((sizeof(c) & 1) > 0)`.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <typename c> void d() {
  __typeof__(sizeof(c) <= 1) e;
  if (!e)
    ;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <typename c> void d() {
  __typeof__((sizeof(c) & 1) > 0) e;
  if (!e)
    ;
}
```

Note: This mutation operator leverages existing variables and elements in the seed program, specifically focusing on modifying the logic within the `__typeof__` construct to invoke different semantic interpretations, potentially triggering bugs related to type casting or evaluation in the compiler.
