Mutation Operator: Modify Array Initialization with Parentheses

Target Code Construct: Array Initialization using Parentheses

Mutation Rule:

1. Identify an array type alias declaration using the `using` keyword. Example: `using T = int[N];` where N is an integer or left unspecified for a flexible array.
2. Locate variables of this array type being initialized using parentheses with values. Example: `T a(42);`
3. Modify the initialization to use brace-initialization instead of parentheses. The values should be placed within braces `{}`.
4. Ensure that the values being used for initialization are compatible with the array size. If the array size is greater than 1, ensure the number of values matches the array size.

Example Before Mutation:
```
using T = int[1];
T a(42);
```

Example After Mutation:
```
using T = int[1];
T a{42};
```

Note: This mutation operator targets array initializations that use parentheses, which may lead to unexpected compiler behavior or crashes, especially with constant arrays. By changing the initialization to use braces, it may help detect areas in the compiler that are not handling such transitions properly. This operator applies to situations where array types are explicitly specified in the program.
