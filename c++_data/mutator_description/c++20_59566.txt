Mutation Operator: Modify Concept Constraints in Template Parameter Declarations

Target: Template Parameter Declarations with Concepts

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template declaration that uses concepts in its parameter list. For instance, a template that has a parameter constrained by a concept like `template<typename T> requires MyConcept<T>`.

2. Modify the concept constraint by introducing an additional logical operation that combines existing concepts. This can include logical AND (`&&`) or OR (`||`) operations to alter the constraints.

3. Step-by-step mutation:
   a. Locate the concept constraint portion of the template parameter. Example: `requires MyConcept<T>`.
   b. Introduce a new logical operation to combine it with another concept. For example, change it to `requires (MyConcept<T> && AnotherConcept<T>)` or `requires (MyConcept<T> || AnotherConcept<T>)`.
   c. Ensure that `AnotherConcept` is a concept that is already defined in the seed program or declare it explicitly if not present, using a simple definition like:
      ```
      template<typename T>
      concept AnotherConcept = requires(T a) {
          // Add simple valid expressions involving T
      };
      ```

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T> requires MyConcept<T>
class MyClass {};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T> requires (MyConcept<T> && AnotherConcept<T>)
class MyClass {};
```

Rationale: By altering the constraints in templates involving concepts, the mutation introduces variations in the template instantiation logic. These changes can stress the compiler's ability to handle complex constraint satisfaction, potentially triggering hidden bugs related to the handling of concepts and template instantiation, thereby increasing the likelihood of uncovering issues such as the one reported.
