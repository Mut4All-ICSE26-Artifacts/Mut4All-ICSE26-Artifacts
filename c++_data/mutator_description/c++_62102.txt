Mutation Operator: Modify Overloaded Operators in Template Instantiations

Target: This mutation operator targets function templates with overloaded operators, specifically within template specializations where the operator is overloaded to take different types.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a function template that defines an overloaded operator, such as `operator==`, and is parameterized by two template types.
2. Ensure that the operator is instantiated with arguments of types that do not directly support the intended binary operation. For instance, use a combination of types like `int` and a user-defined struct or class that do not have a direct comparison operator.
3. Modify the return statement of the function to perform a comparison operation with these incompatible types, ensuring that they do not define an implicit conversion or an operator to resolve the comparison.
4. For example, in a templated function:
   - Original:
     ```
     template <typename T, typename U> constexpr bool operator==(S<T>, S<U> x) {
       return 0 == x;
     }
     ```
   - Mutated:
     ```
     template <typename T, typename U> constexpr bool operator==(S<T>, S<U> x) {
       U y;
       return y == x; // Ensures comparison between potentially incompatible types
     }
     ```
5. Instantiate the template with types that do not naturally support the comparison, ensuring one of the types is a fundamental type like `int` and the other a custom type, such as a user-defined class or struct without an appropriate operator defined.
6. Ensure that the instantiation is triggered in a context where the operator must be resolved, potentially leading to a compiler crash due to the lack of a valid overloaded operator for the given types.

This mutation operator is designed to exploit edge cases in template instantiation and operator overloading resolution, particularly in scenarios where there is an expectation of a valid operation that is not fulfilled, leading to assertions or crashes in the compiler's semantic analysis phase.
