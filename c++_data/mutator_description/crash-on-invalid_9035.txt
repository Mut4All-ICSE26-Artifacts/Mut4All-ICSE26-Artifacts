Mutation Operator: Modifying Class Members

Target Construct: Class/Struct/Union Definition

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class, struct, or union in the seed program.
2. Within the body of the class, struct, or union, locate an existing member variable or function.
3. Modify the name of this member to an invalid identifier, such as including special characters or starting with a number.
4. Ensure the modification does not introduce undeclared variables or types by using only existing members.

Example in Pseudo-code:
Original:
```
class MyClass {
   int myVariable;
   void myFunction();
};
```

Mutation:
```
class MyClass {
   int 1myVariable; // Invalid identifier starting with a number
   void myFunction();
};
```

This mutation operator targets class members and deliberately introduces an invalid identifier name, which is more likely to trigger parsing errors and test the robustness of the compiler's error handling and parsing mechanisms.
