Mutation Operator: Modify Inheritance Structure

Target Code Construct: Structs with Inheritance

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct that inherits from another struct (base class).
2. Replace the inheritance relationship with a composition relationship:
   - Remove the inheritance declaration from the derived struct.
   - Add a member of the base struct type within the derived struct.

Mutation Steps:
- Locate the derived struct definition that inherits from a base struct.
- Remove the inheritance specifier from the derived struct.
- Within the derived struct, declare a new member variable of the base struct type, named "baseMember" for clarity.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Base {};

struct Derived : Base {
    int& a;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct Base {};

struct Derived {
    Base baseMember;
    int& a;
};
```

This mutation operator is designed to explore potential issues with handling struct composition versus inheritance, which can lead to differences in memory layout and object construction in C++ compilers.
