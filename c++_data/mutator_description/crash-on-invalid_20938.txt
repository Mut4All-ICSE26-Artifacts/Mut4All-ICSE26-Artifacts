Mutation Operator: Static Member Function with Incomplete Type

Target Code Construct: Struct with Static Member Function

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct definition in the seed program.
2. Within the struct, define a static member function. This function should have an incomplete type as its return type or as a parameter type.
3. Ensure that the incomplete type is undefined or improperly declared within the same translation unit.

Example Mutation:
Original Code:
```
struct MyStruct {
    static void myFunction();
};
```

Mutated Code:
```
struct MyStruct {
    static IncompleteType myFunction();
};

struct AnotherStruct {
    static void anotherFunction(IncompleteType param);
};
```

Explanation:
- The mutation involves creating a static member function in a struct or class where the return type or parameter type is not properly defined.
- This type of mutation can trigger errors related to type resolution and declaration finalization, potentially leading to compiler crashes if the compiler's error-handling mechanisms are not robust against incomplete types.
