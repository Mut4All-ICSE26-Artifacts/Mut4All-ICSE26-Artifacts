Mutation Operator: Modify Template Instantiation in Class Hierarchies

Target: This mutation operator targets template instantiation within class hierarchies, specifically when an undefined template class is extended or used in a member declaration.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a class that extends a templated base class where the template is declared but not defined (e.g., `class c : b<1> {}`).
2. Modify the class hierarchy by inserting an additional level of inheritance. Create an intermediate class that also extends the undefined template. This modification increases the complexity of the hierarchy and may expose additional issues in how the compiler handles templates and inheritance.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
- Locate a class that directly extends a template with an undefined body. For example, `class c : b<1> {};`.
- Introduce a new intermediate class, `class Intermediate`, that also extends the template `b<1>`.
- Modify the original class to extend from this new intermediate class instead of directly from the template. The modified hierarchy will look like this:
  ```
  class Intermediate : b<1> {}; // New intermediate class

  class c : Intermediate {}; // Original class now extends the new intermediate
  ```
- Ensure that any existing member declarations within the original class that reference the template are retained. For example:
  ```
  template <int> class d : c { // Existing class extending the original class
    struct {

      b<1> e; // Reference to the undefined template
    } f;
  };
  ```
- Test the modified code with the compiler to check if the mutation introduces a crash. The added level in the inheritance hierarchy may trigger issues in the compiler's handling of template instantiation and class inheritance.

This mutation operator is designed to leverage existing code structures, focusing on modifying the inheritance hierarchy to expose potential compiler bugs related to templates and class inheritance.
