Mutation Operator: Overload Function Template Specialization with Incompatible Constraints

Target: Function templates with constrained parameters.

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. **Identify a function template** that utilizes a constrained template parameter. 
   Example:
   ```cpp
   template<typename T>
   concept C = requires(T t) { f(t); };

   auto f(C auto);
   ```

2. **Add a new overloaded version of the function** with a similar template constraint structure but with an incompatible or conflicting requirement.
   - Introduce a new concept that seemingly conflicts with or overly restricts the existing concept.
   Example:
   ```cpp
   template<typename T>
   concept D = requires(T t) { g(t); }; // Introduces a conflicting requirement

   auto f(D auto); // Overloaded function with a different constraint
   ```

3. **Invoke the function with an argument type** that does not satisfy both constraints simultaneously.
   Example:
   ```cpp
   void g() {
      f(0); // 0 doesn't satisfy both C and D, which may lead to ambiguity or constraint satisfaction issues.
   }
   ```

Rationale: This mutation introduces ambiguous or conflicting template constraints that challenge the compiler's constraint satisfaction logic, potentially leading to crashes or assertion failures. By creating scenarios where the compiler struggles to deduce or satisfy constraints due to incompatible overloads, we aim to explore edge cases in template constraint handling.
