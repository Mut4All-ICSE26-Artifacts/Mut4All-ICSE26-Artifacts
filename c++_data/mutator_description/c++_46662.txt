Mutation Operator: Modify Destructor Declarations

Target Code Construct: Class Destructor

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a class declaration within the seed program. This class must have at least one member variable or function.
2. If the class does not have a user-declared destructor, add a declaration of an explicit destructor to the class. For instance, if the class is named `MyClass`, add `~MyClass();` to the class declaration.
3. If a destructor is already declared, modify it by introducing overload resolution complications. This can be done by:
   a. Adding a virtual keyword if it is not already present, to ensure the destructor is polymorphic.
   b. Introduce a default or delete specifier, if C++11 or later is being used, such as `~MyClass() = default;` or `~MyClass() = delete;`.
4. Ensure that for the added or modified destructor, there is no corresponding definition outside the class, simulating a scenario where the destructor's implementation is missing.
5. If the class is part of an inheritance hierarchy, ensure that the base class has a non-virtual destructor and then declare a virtual destructor in the derived class to create a conflict.

Example (Pseudo-code):
Original:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    void func();
};
```

Mutated:
```
class MyClass {
public:
    int value;
    void func();
    virtual ~MyClass() = delete; // Declaration of a virtual deleted destructor
};
```

This mutation focuses on modifying destructor declarations to introduce inconsistencies or complexities that compilers may not handle gracefully, leading to potential assertion failures or crashes, particularly in the presence of inheritance.
