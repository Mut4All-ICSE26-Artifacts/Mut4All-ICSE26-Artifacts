Mutation Operator: Inconsistent Template Typedef and Struct

Target: Type alias templates and struct definitions within them.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a type alias template in the seed program using the `using` keyword, such as `template <class T> using AliasName = ...;`.
2. Within the type alias template, introduce a struct definition with the same name as the type alias template.
3. Ensure that the struct contains at least one member variable which uses the template parameter `T`.
4. Attempt to instantiate the type alias without providing a template argument, which causes ambiguity and potential misuse of the template.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <class T> using MyAlias = T;
MyAlias<int> variable;
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <class T> using MyAlias = struct MyAlias {
  T value;
};
MyAlias variable;
```

Explanation:
The mutation involves creating a struct with the same name as the alias within a type alias template and then attempting to instantiate the alias without a type argument. This inconsistency can trigger compiler issues, particularly related to template parameter handling and type alias conflicts, similar to the behavior observed in the bug report.
