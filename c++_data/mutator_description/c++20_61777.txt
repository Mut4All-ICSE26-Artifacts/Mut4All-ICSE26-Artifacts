Mutation Operator:
Target: Class Templates with Constrained Non-Type Template Parameters (NTTPs)

Mutation Rule:
This mutation operator targets class template declarations that contain nested templates with constrained non-type template parameters using C++20 concepts. The goal is to alter the template parameters and constraints to explore potential issues in constraint satisfaction and expression evaluation. Follow the steps below:

1. Identify a class template that contains a nested template with a constrained NTTP. For example:
   ```cpp
   template <class> concept C = true;
   template <class> struct S {
     template <class, C auto> struct N {};
   };
   ```

2. Introduce an additional layer of templates to increase complexity. Wrap the nested template in another template class or function. For example:
   ```cpp
   template <class T> struct Wrapper {
     template <class U, C auto V> struct Inner : S<T>::template N<U, V> {};
   };
   ```

3. Alter the constraint in the concept used for NTTPs to something more complex or introduce alternative concepts that can modify the behavior. For example:
   ```cpp
   template <class T> concept D = sizeof(T) > 1;
   template <class> struct S {
     template <class, D auto> struct N {};
   };
   ```

4. Utilize assertions or static assertions to instantiate the template and evaluate the constraints, potentially with differing types or values that could cause the compiler to encounter edge cases:
   ```cpp
   static_assert(Wrapper<int>::Inner<int, 1>::value == 0);
   ```

5. Ensure the mutation maintains valid C++ syntax while exploring varied combinations and permutations of template parameters and constraints to stress-test the compiler's handling of these constructs.

By focusing on class templates with constrained NTTPs and introducing additional layers of templates or modifying constraints, this mutation operator leverages areas known to challenge compilers, particularly with C++20 features like concepts. The aim is to expose bugs related to constraint satisfaction, template instantiation, and expression evaluation within the compiler.
