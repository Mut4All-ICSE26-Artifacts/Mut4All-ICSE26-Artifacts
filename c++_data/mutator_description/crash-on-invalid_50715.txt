Based on the bug report provided, the C++ compiler crash is triggered by an invalid use of a static union with an incomplete array type and an inappropriate initializer. The bug is related to the improper use of unions and initializers, particularly with arrays. Mutating such constructs can help identify similar issues in the compiler.

Mutation Operator:
Target Construct: Union with Array Members

Step-by-Step Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a union definition in the code. The union should have at least one member of an array type.
2. Change the array member to be of an incomplete type if it is not already (i.e., remove the array size if specified).
3. Attempt to initialize this union using a non-array type initializer such as a floating-point number, which is not compatible with the array member.
4. Ensure the union is declared as a static variable within a function or a namespace scope.

Example Mutated Content:
Given a seed code with a union like this:

union U {
  int y[5];
};

Transform it to:

void bar()
{
  static union U {
    int y[];
  } u = {2.5};
}

This mutation aims to generate a scenario where the compiler has to handle invalid initialization of a union with an array member, potentially leading to a crash or error, similar to the original bug report scenario.
