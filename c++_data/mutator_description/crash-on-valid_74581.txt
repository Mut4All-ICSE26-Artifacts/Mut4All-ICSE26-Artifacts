Mutation Operator: Modify Template Constraints with Self-referential Constructs

Target Code Construct: Template function definitions with "requires" clauses that use self-referential constructs within the constraint expression.

Mutation Rule: 
1. Identify a template function that has a "requires" clause using concepts or type traits involving template parameters.
2. Modify the constraint expression to introduce self-referential constructs or circular dependencies among template parameters. This can often cause the compiler to crash due to infinite recursion in constraint satisfaction evaluation.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate the "requires" clause in the template function declaration.
- Identify a type trait or constraint that can be made self-referential. In the given bug report, the constraint 'std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<F>, F>' was used.
- Introduce a similar circular dependency by replacing the existing constraint with one that depends on itself.
  Example mutation:
  Original: 
  ```
  template <typename F>
      requires std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<F>, F>
  Derived(F&& f);
  ```
  Mutated:
  ```
  template <typename F>
      requires std::is_constructible_v<F, std::decay_t<F>>
  Derived(F&& f);
  ```
- Ensure that the mutated constraint is well-formed syntactically but introduces a logical circular dependency.

Example Application:
- Before Mutation:
  ```cpp
  template <typename X>
      requires std::is_constructible_v<std::decay_t<X>, X>
  void exampleFunction(X&& x);
  ```

- After Mutation:
  ```cpp
  template <typename X>
      requires std::is_constructible_v<X, std::decay_t<X>>
  void exampleFunction(X&& x);
  ```

Note: This mutation is likely to trigger a crash in compilers due to the recursive nature of the constraint, which makes it difficult for the compiler to resolve the constraint satisfaction, leading to potential infinite loops or stack overflows during compilation.
