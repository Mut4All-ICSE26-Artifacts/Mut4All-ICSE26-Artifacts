Mutation Operator: Implicit Member Initialization in Template Struct

Target Code Construct: Template Struct with Implicit Member Initialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template function or class where a struct is defined inside it.
2. Within the struct, locate a member variable that is initialized using an implicit self-reference (e.g., `int x = x;`).
3. Change the implicit member initialization to explicitly use a default initializer or another member's value. If using another member's value, ensure that the member is initialized before using it.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <typename T>
void sample_function() {
  struct B {
    int value = value;
  };
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <typename T>
void sample_function() {
  struct B {
    int value = 0; // Changed from self-reference to explicit value
  };
}
```

In this mutation, the potential for a crash is reduced by ensuring that the member variable `value` is initialized with a valid default value rather than an implicit self-reference, which may not be valid or defined. This operator can be applied to any struct defined within a template function or class where implicit member initialization occurs.
