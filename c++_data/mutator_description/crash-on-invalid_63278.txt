Mutation Operator: Modify Auto Type in Struct Definition

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets the use of `auto` as a non-static data member within a struct or class definition.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct or class definition that contains a non-static data member declared with the `auto` keyword.
2. Within this struct or class, if there is at least one other data member that is explicitly typed (e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`), ensure that it is initialized inline.
3. Change the `auto` declaration to another valid type that matches the initializer. If the type cannot be easily inferred, choose a primitive type like `int` or `double`.
4. Ensure that the changes maintain syntactical correctness without introducing additional dependencies or new variable declarations.

Example Before Mutation:
```
struct Example {
  int a{5};
  auto b = 3.14; 
};
```

Example After Mutation:
```
struct Example {
  int a{5};
  double b = 3.14; 
};
```

Explanation:
The mutation operator modifies the `auto` data member `b` by replacing `auto` with an appropriate type (`double` in this case) that matches the initializer value. This transformation prevents potential compiler confusion that might lead to a crash, especially when there are multiple data members initialized inline. This operator ensures the change is clear and does not introduce any ambiguity regarding the type or initial value of the data member.
