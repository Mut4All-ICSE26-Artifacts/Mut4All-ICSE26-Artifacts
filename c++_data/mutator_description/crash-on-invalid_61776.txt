Mutation Operator:

Target Code Construct: Concept Requirements

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify the usage of a concept requirement in the code, specifically within a `requires` clause.
2. Within the `requires` clause, locate the use of an auto type specifier with the concept, e.g., `requires (Concept auto x)`.
3. Modify the `auto` type specifier to use a concrete type that doesn't match the concept's expectation. For instance, if the concept expects a type with specific properties or operations, use a type that lacks those properties or operations.
4. Ensure that this mismatch leads to a type that does not satisfy the concept requirement, potentially causing the compiler to reach an assertion failure.

Example (Pseudo-code form):
Original Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = requires (C auto x) { x; };
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = requires (C int x) { x; };
// Here, the concept `C` expects `x` to match its constraints, but `int` deliberately does not.
```

Rationale:
The mutation replaces `auto` with a specific type that doesn't fulfill the concept `C`'s requirements, challenging the compiler's ability to evaluate the validity of the expression within the concept. This approach targets the mechanism by which the compiler checks concept satisfaction, potentially uncovering assertion failures related to dependent expressions.
