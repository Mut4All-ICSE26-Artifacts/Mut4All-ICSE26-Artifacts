Mutation Operator: Modify Template Instantiation with Conditional Typedef

Target: This mutation operator targets template struct instantiations in C++ code, specifically those involving `enable_if` or similar conditional typedef constructs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template struct that uses a conditional typedef, such as `enable_if`, within a member function or a static method.
2. Within the template struct, locate the conditional typedef usage, such as `typename enable_if<Foo<T>::bar, void>::Type`.
3. Modify the condition in the typedef to introduce a scenario where the condition is ambiguous or likely to evaluate incorrectly.
4. Example mutation: Change `Foo<T>::bar` to a condition less determinable, such as `sizeof(T) > -1` or `std::is_same<T, T>::value`.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
struct ExampleStruct
{
  template <bool B, typename U = void> struct enable_if;
  template <typename U> struct enable_if<true, U> { typedef U Type; };

  template <typename T>
  static typename enable_if<Foo<T>::bar, void>::Type exampleMethod()
  {
  }
};
```

After Mutation:
```
struct ExampleStruct
{
  template <bool B, typename U = void> struct enable_if;
  template <typename U> struct enable_if<true, U> { typedef U Type; };

  template <typename T>
  static typename enable_if<sizeof(T) > -1, void>::Type exampleMethod()
  {
  }
};
```

Note: This mutation operator aims to exploit potential issues with conditional typedef resolution in templates by providing conditions that are tricky or edge cases. This can trigger compiler errors or crashes that are not handled gracefully, especially in code paths that assume conditions are always valid.
