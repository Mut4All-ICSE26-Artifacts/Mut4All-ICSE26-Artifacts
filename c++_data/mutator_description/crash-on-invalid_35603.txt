Mutation Operator: Inserting Invalid Enum Declaration

Target: Enum Declarations

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an existing enum declaration in the C++ source code.
2. Introduce a new enumerator with an invalid name or syntax into the enum. For example, use a reserved keyword or a malformed identifier as an enumerator name.
3. If no enum exists, introduce a new enum with an invalid enumerator into the code, preferably at a global scope or within an existing class or namespace to ensure visibility.

Step-by-step Instructions:
- Locate an existing enum block in the seed program, such as:
  ```cpp
  enum Color { Red, Green, Blue };
  ```
- Modify it by adding an enumerator with an invalid identifier, e.g.:
  ```cpp
  enum Color { Red, Green, Blue, int }; // 'int' is a reserved keyword
  ```
- If no existing enum is present, introduce a new enum:
  ```cpp
  enum Status { Valid, Invalid, 123Invalid }; // '123Invalid' starts with a digit
  ```

The mutation should use the current context of the program to integrate seamlessly, and if new types or variables are introduced, they should be appropriately declared following the rules above.
