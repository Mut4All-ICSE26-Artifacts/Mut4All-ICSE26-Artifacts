Mutation Operator: Modify Range-Based For Loop Conditions

Target: Range-based for loops in C++ code.

Mutation Rule:
- Identify any range-based for loop in the code.
- Replace the range variable with a ternary conditional expression that uses existing variables or constants in the program context.
- Ensure the ternary expression introduces a logical inconsistency or redundancy, such as comparing against an array or using unrelated variables/types.

Step-by-Step Mutation Example:
1. Original code snippet:
   ```
   int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
   for (int x : arr) {
       // process x
   }
   ```

2. Mutation:
   - Replace `arr` with a ternary conditional expression involving an existing variable, or introduce a new array with another ternary expression to induce inconsistency. Introduce a logical error by comparing elements of different types.
   ```
   int n = 1;
   int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
   for (int x : (n > 0 ? arr : newArr)) {
       // process x
   }
   ```

   Here, `newArr` should be declared prior, possibly with a different type or unrelated context to cause ambiguity:
   ```
   double newArr[] = {1.1, 2.2, 3.3};
   ```

   This mutation introduces a potential type mismatch or semantic confusion, leveraging existing variables but creating conditions that may not logically make sense, aiming to stress the compiler's handling of range-based for loops and conditional expressions.
