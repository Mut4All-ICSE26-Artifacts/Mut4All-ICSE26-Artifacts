Mutation Operator: Struct Typedef Conflict

Target Code Construct: Typedef and Struct Definitions
This mutation operator applies to scenarios where a typedef name conflicts with struct definitions within a scope, potentially causing assertion failures or compiler crashes.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify any typedefs in the seed program that define a new type name. For example, typedef int INTEGER;.
2. Within the same scope where the typedef is visible, declare a new struct or class with a name identical to the typedef name. For instance, struct INTEGER { char c; };.
3. Ensure that the struct or class does not have a complete definition before being used in expressions or as a type in expressions or statements within the same function or block.
4. Utilize the newly declared struct or class in a manner that would typically require a complete definition, such as instantiation or assignment.

Example:
Original Code:
```
typedef float FLOAT;
void example() {
    FLOAT value = 3.14;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```
typedef float FLOAT;
void example() {
    struct FLOAT { int x; };  // Conflicting name with typedef
    FLOAT value = 3.14; // Compiler may attempt to resolve FLOAT as struct
}
```

This mutation operator exploits the ambiguity and potential conflict between typedefed names and struct or class definitions with identical names, aiming to trigger parsing issues or assertion failures in the compiler.
