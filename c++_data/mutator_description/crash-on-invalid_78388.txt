Mutation Operator: Incomplete Struct Declaration in Template

Target Code Construct:
This mutation operator targets the declaration of structs within template classes.

Mutation Rule:
Step 1: Identify a template class declaration in the seed program.
Step 2: Within the template class, declare a nested struct with a missing semicolon at the end of the declaration.
Step 3: Ensure that the struct declaration lacks a name, making it an anonymous struct.
Step 4: Assign the anonymous struct to a variable within the template class.

Example:
Original Code:
template <typename T>
class ExampleTemplate {
    // Other members and functions
};

Mutated Code:
template <typename T>
class ExampleTemplate {
    // Introduce an anonymous struct with a missing semicolon
    struct : ExampleTemplate<T> {} instance
    // Other members and functions
};

Note:
- This mutation takes advantage of the common pattern of using nested types within templates.
- The absence of a semicolon and the use of an anonymous struct is designed to confuse the compiler's parser and trigger errors related to incomplete declaration handling.
- This mutation should be applied where there is already a template class present in the code and does not introduce new elements that are not declared.
