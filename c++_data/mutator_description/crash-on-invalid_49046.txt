Mutation Operator: Modify Template Argument Constraints

Target Code Construct: Template argument constraints within templated structures

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify templates with constrained non-type template parameters (NTTPs). Specifically, locate templates where the NTTPs are constrained by a concept.
2. Modify the constraint expression of these NTTPs to include additional logical operations or conditions that may be semantically irrelevant or logically contradictory.
3. Ensure that the additional conditions use existing concepts or simple logical operations on existing types or variables.
4. Apply the changes within the parameter declarations of template definitions or template specializations.

Example of Mutation:
Consider the following template definition and usage:

Original:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = true;

template<template<C auto...> typename Templ>
struct template_ {};
```

Mutated:
```cpp
template<typename T>
concept C = true;

template<template<(C && sizeof...(auto) > 0) auto...> typename Templ>
struct template_ {};
```

In this mutation, the constraint `(C && sizeof...(auto) > 0)` is introduced, adding an additional condition that modifies the original concept constraint. It uses the logical 'and' operator to combine the existing concept with a condition that checks the size of the parameter pack. This introduces complexity that could potentially expose compiler issues when handling such constraints.
