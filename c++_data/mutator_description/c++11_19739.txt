Mutation Operator: Inheritance with Constructor Specialization

Target Code Construct: Class Inheritance and Constructor Specialization

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a base class with a default constructor.
2. Derive a subclass from the identified base class.
3. Explicitly specialize the base class constructor in the derived class with the same signature.
4. Ensure that the derived class does not have any additional constructors defined.

Example Mutation:

Original Code:
- class Base {
      public:
          Base() {}
  };
  
- class Derived : public Base {
  };

Mutated Code:
- class Base {
      public:
          Base() {}
  };
  
- class Derived : public Base {
      public:
          using Base::Base;
  };

Rationale:
This mutation operator focuses on a case where the use of an inherited constructor specialization in C++11 could potentially expose vulnerabilities or inconsistencies in the compiler's handling of constructor specializations, particularly when interacting with base class methods. By explicitly specializing the inherited constructor while the derived class does not define its own, the code is more likely to trigger issues related to constructor resolution and inheritance handling in compilers.
