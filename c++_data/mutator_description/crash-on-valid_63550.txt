Based on this bug report, it is observed that C++ compiler bugs are often triggered by operations involving atomic types and unexpected behavior during code generation, specifically related to mismatches in expected sizes of emitted constants. Mutation operators that focus on the manipulation of atomic types, pointer assignments, and bitwise operations are likely to trigger similar issues.

Mutation Operator:
Target: Global variable declarations with atomic types and initialization.

Precise Mutation Rule:
1. Identify global variables declared with `_Atomic` keyword.
2. If the variable is initialized with a value, change the type of the initializer to a different type that is still compatible but could cause size or representation issues with the atomic type.
3. Apply this mutation selectively to pointers and integer types, as they have a higher chance of causing mismatches.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
_Atomic(int *) b = 0;
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
_Atomic(int *) b = (int *)1;  // Change the initializer from 0 (null pointer) to (int *)1 (non-null pointer)
```

Explanation:
In the original code, the variable `b` is an atomic pointer initialized to zero (null pointer). The mutation changes the initializer to a non-null pointer with an integer value, potentially causing issues during code generation due to differences in expected sizes or representations. This mutation operator exploits potential mismatches in handling atomic variables and their initializers, increasing the likelihood of triggering a compiler bug.
