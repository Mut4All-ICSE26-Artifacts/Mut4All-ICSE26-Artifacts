Mutation Operator: Modify Static Assertions within Anonymous Structs

Target Construct: Static assertions within anonymous structs.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an anonymous struct that includes a static assertion, such as `_Static_assert(!(__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof(*mcurrent), int)))`.
2. Modify the expression within the static assertion to introduce more complex type compatibility checks.
3. Specifically, replace the existing types with types already available in the surrounding code. If no suitable types are present, introduce a simple built-in type such as `double` or `float` for variety.
4. Ensure the logic within the static assertion is more intricate by adding logical operators. For example, use `(a && b)` or `(a || b)` to combine multiple type compatibility checks.
5. Verify that the static assertion syntax remains correct and that the compound statement structure is preserved.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct { _Static_assert(!(__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof(*mcurrent), int))) };
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct { 
    _Static_assert(
        (__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof(*mcurrent), double)) || 
        (__builtin_types_compatible_p(typeof(*mcurrent), float))
    );
};
```

This mutation targets the compiler's ability to handle complex logical expressions within static assertions in anonymous structs. By introducing additional complexity and type variety, the mutation increases the chance of interacting with edge cases in the compiler's type-checking mechanisms, potentially leading to a crash in scenarios where the compiler struggles with intricate logical evaluations.
