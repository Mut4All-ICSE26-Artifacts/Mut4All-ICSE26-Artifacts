Mutation Operator: Struct Member Access Modifier Mutation

Target Code Construct: Struct or Class

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a struct or class in the code.
2. Select a member variable or function within the struct or class.
3. If the selected member is declared under a particular access specifier (public, private, or protected), change its access specifier to another one that is not currently used in the struct or class.
4. Ensure that the change keeps the code syntactically valid but potentially semantically incorrect, which might trigger the compiler to behave unexpectedly.

Example:
Original Code:
```
struct Example {
    int memberVar;
    void memberFunc();
};
```

Mutation:
1. Identify the member variable `memberVar` declared as public by default.
2. Change its access specifier to private or protected.
3. Resulting mutated code:
```
struct Example {
private:
    int memberVar;
public:
    void memberFunc();
};
```

This mutation introduces potential access conflicts, which could cause the compiler to crash when attempting to parse or compile the mutated code. It takes advantage of the compiler's handling of access specifiers and can expose weaknesses in the compiler's front-end processing, particularly in instances where access rules are incorrectly checked or enforced.
