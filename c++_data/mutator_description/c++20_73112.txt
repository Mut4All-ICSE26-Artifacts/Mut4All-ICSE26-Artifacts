Mutation Operator  
Target: Requires Clause in Function Body  
Description: This mutation operator targets the misuse of the 'requires' clause within a function body. The operator modifies the syntax of a valid 'requires' clause to an improperly nested or malformed expression, which can trigger parsing errors or crashes in the compiler.  

Mutation Rule:  
1. Identify a valid 'requires' clause within a function body.  
2. Modify the 'requires' clause to include an incomplete or malformed nested expression.  

Example:  
Original Code:  
```cpp
int main() {  
    requires { requires (true); }  
}
```  

Mutated Code:  
```cpp
int main() {  
    requires { requires (int; }  // Introduced a syntax error by removing a parenthesis and adding a semicolon
}
```

Details: The mutation operator transforms a syntactically correct 'requires' clause into one with a common mistake such as missing parentheses or incorrect punctuation. This can help identify weaknesses in the compiler's ability to handle malformed 'requires' clauses within function bodies, which is a structure prone to triggering compiler bugs, especially with new C++20 features like concepts and requires expressions.
