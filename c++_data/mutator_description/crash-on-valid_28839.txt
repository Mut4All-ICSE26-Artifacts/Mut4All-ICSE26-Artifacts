Mutation Operator: Enum Type Mutation

Target Code Construct: Enum Declaration

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify an enum declaration in the seed program.
2. Introduce a new enumerator value into the existing enum. The new value should be inserted between two existing enumerator values or at the end of the enum list.
3. Ensure that the new enumerator does not exceed typical range limits for enums (e.g., avoiding excessively large values that could result in unexpected behavior).
4. The new enumerator must be properly named following the naming convention used by the existing enumerators.

Example:
Original Code:
```
enum Color {
    RED,
    GREEN,
    BLUE
};
```

Mutation:
1. Insert a new enumerator between existing ones or at the end.
2. Example insertion:
```
enum Color {
    RED,
    YELLOW, // Inserted enumerator
    GREEN,
    BLUE
};
```

Rationale:
Mutating enum declarations by inserting new enumerators can explore how the compiler handles extensions to type lists and can potentially trigger issues around type evaluations, especially if combined with other constructs like template instantiations or function overloads that utilize these enums. This kind of mutation is likely to expose weaknesses in the compiler's handling of enum type evaluations, which could lead to assertion failures or crashes.
