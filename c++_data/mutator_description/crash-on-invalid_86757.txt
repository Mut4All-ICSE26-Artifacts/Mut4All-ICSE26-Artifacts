Mutation Operator: Modify Include Directives

Target: Include Directive

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify all `#include` directives in the source code.
2. Select an existing valid include directive, such as `#include <iostream>`.
3. Modify the selected include directive by changing the header name to a non-existent or incorrect one. For example, change `#include <iostream>` to `#include <nonexistent_header>`.
4. Ensure the modified header name is syntactically valid but does not correspond to any actual header file in the environment or library used.

This mutation can be applied to any include directive in the program and aims to simulate scenarios where a missing header can lead to unexpected compiler behaviors. By inducing an error in the include directive, the mutation operator can potentially trigger assertion failures or crashes in the compiler's error handling paths, similar to the crash described in the bug report.
