Mutation Operator: Modify Member Operator Delete

Target: This mutation operator targets member operator delete functions within class definitions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a member operator delete definition within a class. The operator delete function is defined with the keyword `operator delete` and is a member function of a class.
2. Check if the first parameter of the operator delete is a class type. If it is, proceed to modify it.
3. Change the first parameter type to a pointer type, such as `void*`. This aligns with the standard requirement for operator delete.
4. Ensure that any function calls or usage within the operator delete body are modified to handle the pointer type, if necessary.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
struct MyClass {
  void operator delete(OtherClass obj) {
    // function body
  }
};

void myFunction(MyClass *ptr) {
  delete ptr;
}
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
struct MyClass {
  void operator delete(void* ptr) {
    // Adjust function body to handle ptr as a pointer
  }
};

void myFunction(MyClass *ptr) {
  delete ptr; // No change necessary here
}
```

Explanation: This mutation operator focuses on ensuring that member operator delete functions are defined with the correct parameter type, which is crucial for correct deletion semantics and avoiding crashes. By changing the parameter from a class type to a `void*`, we align it with standard C++ expectations and eliminate the crash-inducing condition.
