Mutation Operator: Modify Template Type Constraints

Target Code Construct: Template specialization with type constraints.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a template specialization in the code, which includes a `requires` clause with `IsSame` or similar constraint expressions.
2. Locate the `requires` clause that is dependent on a template type parameter.
3. Modify the `requires` clause to introduce an additional constraint involving a dependent type that does not resolve to a specific type at compile time, thereby creating a dependency.
4. Specifically, replace an existing constraint like `requires(IsSame<T, U>)` within the template function or constructor with a more complex expression involving an additional type `V` such as `requires(IsSame<T, U> || IsSame<U, V>)` where `V` introduces a dependency.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
template <typename T> struct Test {
  Test() requires(IsSame<T, Empty>);
};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
template <typename T, typename V> struct Test {
  Test() requires(IsSame<T, Empty> || IsSame<T, V>);
};
```

Explanation:
The mutation modifies the constraint to introduce an additional type, V, which could potentially lead to a dependent expression. This modification increases the likelihood of triggering a scenario that the compiler's expression evaluation logic may not handle correctly, especially when the additional dependency is not fully resolved at compile time.
