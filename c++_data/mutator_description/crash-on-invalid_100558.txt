Mutation Operator 1: Modify Lambda Return Type

Target Code Construct: Lambda Functions

Mutation Rule:
- Identify lambda functions in the program, especially those with specified return types.
- Change the return type of the lambda function to a non-existent or invalid type to trigger a compiler bug.
- Ensure that the lambda function body still attempts to return a value of a previously expected type, leading to a type mismatch.

Example:
Original Code:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](float x) -> float {
    return x;
};
```

Mutated Code:
```cpp
auto lambda = [](float x) -> non_existent_type {
    return x;
};
```

This mutation deliberately changes the return type to a non-existent type, which is likely to cause a compiler error during type checking, especially in the context of C++23 where lambda and template handling might introduce new complexities. This operator is applicable broadly to any code base utilizing lambda functions with explicit return types.
