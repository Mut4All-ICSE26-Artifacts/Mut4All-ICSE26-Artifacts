Mutation Operator: Constructor Identifier Modification

Target Code Construct: Constructors within struct or class definitions.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify constructors within a struct or class.
2. Check if an identifier (e.g., a type or variable name) is incorrectly placed before the constructor's definition, which could mimic the format of a function returning a type.
3. Remove the extraneous identifier from in front of the constructor to align with proper constructor syntax.

Example:
Before Mutation:
struct Example {
  int a;
  someType Example() : a(5) {}
};

After Mutation:
struct Example {
  int a;
  Example() : a(5) {}
};

Explanation:
This mutation operator targets the misuse of identifiers before constructor definitions, which may lead to compiler confusion, especially in constant expressions. By removing the incorrect identifier, we adhere to the correct syntax and can expose how compilers handle such corrections. This operator has broad applicability across seed programs with struct or class definitions.
