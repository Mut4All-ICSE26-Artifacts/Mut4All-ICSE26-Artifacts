Mutation Operator: Lambda Expression with Decltype

Target Construct:
This mutation operator targets lambda expressions and decltype specifiers within a C++ program.

Mutation Rule:
1. Identify a lambda expression within the existing code. This is a block of code starting with square brackets '[]' and followed by an optional parameter list and body enclosed in braces '{}'.
2. Modify the return type of the lambda to use a decltype expression. Specifically, apply decltype(this) as the return type of the lambda.
3. Ensure that the lambda expression is part of a class member function, where 'this' is valid, to trigger potential issues with decltype and lambda parsing.
4. If a lambda inside a member function is not present, introduce a simple class with a member function containing the lambda expression.

Example:
Before Mutation:
```
class Container {
    void process() {
        auto lambda = []() { return 42; };
    }
};
```

After Mutation:
```
class Container {
    void process() {
        auto lambda = []() -> decltype(this) { return *this; };
    }
};
```

This mutation operator exploits the interaction between lambda expressions and the use of decltype within member functions, which can stress the compiler's ability to handle complex type deduction scenarios and potentially trigger a crash or assertion failure in the parser.
